The goal of the practice is to assist people to better understand and visualize the world around them, based on an objective empirical analysis.  To provide organisations with relevant and timely market information through the collection, mining, fusing, analyzing and reporting of data in an economic and effective mode.  ------------ The fast pace of software development over the years has encouraged enterprises to adopt individual solutions to address particular operational situations. It is not uncommon for organizations to have different databases that do not ‘talk’ to each other holding different bits of information. They have little opportunity and foresight to devise a strategic enterprise resource plan (ERP) to ensure that their data is not only complete but accessible and manageable giving top management the information necessary to take the right decisions at the right time.  In addition, the advent of social media and development of internet-based databases that are relevant and complementary to an organization’s data has further enhanced the prospect of obtaining previously inconceivable data insights into a business or market. An organization’s ability to process meaningful information gives it a massive advantage in its market place and is the catalyst for growth or survival. Large multinational corporations have the resources to keep abreast of these developments but smaller organizations very often struggle to manage and make optimal use of their data. These SMEs represent the bulk of enterprises in the EU, particularly in small member states. Many of these SMEs seek to expand their operations intra-EU but find it almost impossible without the transmutation of data – information - knowledge. Blackcoffer Europe is committed to simplify the arduous processes required to integrate, manage, structure, query and analyse highly unstructured data and to transform it into knowledge even at very limited budgets. This is the game changer. Ajay Bidyarthy founded Blackcoffer. He is instrumental in driving business, strategy and leadership.

The goal of the practice is to assist people to better understand and visualize the world around them, based on an objective empirical analysis.  The Oil & Gas industry has become very competitive in the last 10 years with the emergence of new technologies in the clean energy arena. The concern for “Climate Change” has led countries to implement a plethora of clean energy policies and also fillip and support the growth and usage of electric vehicles. We may witness a near future where the demand for vehicles with internal combustion engines would be reduced because of the incentives by government and technological advancement. Still, our dependence on Oil & Gas is not going to wane away because of its requirement in a large number of industrial as well as consumer products.  To stay competitive, oil and gas industry needs to innovate upon the cost of production. The cost of production doesn’t depend only on new technologies but a better strategy before investing in an asset. Blackcoffer’s capability to provide data on oil & gas assets and its expertise in delivering data-driven reports can be an important step in the implementing the strategy effectively.  “The limitless energy of the sun can be harnessed in a photovoltaic cell” was first reported in 1954 by the New York Times. The technology was a great breakthrough not only in the area of capturing energy to run our planet but also a solution to a present problem of great concern – “Climate Change”.  The solar industry like most sectors is rapidly embracing ways to analyze and crunch data in order to lower the cost of solar energy and to open up new markets for their technology. Blackcoffer has been instrumental to provide its expertise of data-driven solutions across industries and constant innovation has been the key to our success in the solutions for the energy industry. Solar data has historically “been fairly disorganized,” and the industry has little information about who builds quality solar projects and other parameters aiding the decision-making process of firms. Blackcoffer is bridging this gap through its commitment towards data-driven clean energy solutions.  Nuclear power offers an abundant source of carbon-free energy. Most governments and energy corporations aim to curb climate-changing emissions. The part that gets tricky is trying to decide how exactly to achieve that and nuclear power is one of the solutions. The radioactive waste is, however, a bigger concern for the nuclear power industry. The U.S. operates more nuclear plants than any other country. And although nuclear generates about 25 percent of our country’s energy, that proportion is smaller than in countries such as France where nuclear accounts for 75 percent of the power. \r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  The accident-prone nature and widespread loss to life and property if an accident occurs at the nuclear power plant is an issue that cannot be compromised and therefore requires attention as well as the implementation of sophisticated safety practices. Blackcoffer is working on artificial neural networks that are able to predict the behavior of the system with good accuracy in each scenario. Its ability to provide technical data and statistical results can help decision makers to take actions more rapidly, identify safety issues, or provide an intelligent system with the potential of using pattern recognition for reactor accident identification and classification.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  Clean renewable energy from sources such as the wind has been moving to the forefront of social awareness and public policy. As wind energy becomes more economically competitive, wind farm operators must understand and manage the performance analysis of their farms in order to achieve desired production and revenue goals. But farm operators face a deluge of data from multiple sensors connected to wind turbines' complex systems. Big data and analytics are resulting in disruptive innovation across many industry sectors. Given the uncertainty and complexity associated with wind energy systems, there is huge potential for these techniques to significantly improve the performance and reduce the costs of wind energy systems.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  Predictive modeling in this field can help in getting very informative insights into the process strategic investment by firms at different locations across geographies. The need of the hour is to collect important data points that can help the company in the decision making process. Blackcoffer’s expertise in providing Big Data analytics services can help firms with their decisions. Also, our industry reports are built on the foundation of decreasing the complexity of data and making it presentable to the CXO’s with the best practices of data visualization aiding in the decision-making process.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  Blackcoffer provide advanced analytic models of business processes to assist you in making optimal decisions.  \r\n                            4/2, E-Extn, Shyam Vihar Phase 1, Najafgarh, Delhi - 110043, India"},

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/what-jobs-will-robots-take-from-humans-in-the-future/", "title": "What Jobs Will Robots Take From Humans in The Future? | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "AI is rapidly evolving in the employment sector, particularly in matters involving business and finance. Finance, management, economics, and accounting are now among the most popular university courses globally; particularly at the graduate level, due to their high employability. However, the evolution of machinery in industries is changing that. According to research, 230,000 jobs in these sectors may be replaced by AI agents in the next 5 years. This is due to the nature of the work, as employees are responsible for tasks such as data analysis and keeping track of numerical information; which machines excel at. Large, complicated data sets can be analyzed faster and more efficiently by AI-powered computers than by people. Algorithmic trading procedures that produce automated deals are less likely to be produced without minute errors when undertaken by humans. In such matters involving industrial work, a subsection of artificial intelligence is used; namely, machine learning. Machine learning is a term used for the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in systems, which involves them assimilating and processing information by gaining experience. It is mainly concerned with the development of technology and computer programs.  Its improvement process is mainly divided into seven steps; which start with the collection of data. This data can be collected from an internal database or perhaps an IoT structure. The second and most time-consuming step is cleaning, preparing, and rearranging the data; which involves the recognition of outliers, trends, and missing information so that the outcome is as accurate as possible. The third step consists of formatting data; which is useful if you source your information from a variety of sources. Step four is where AI comes into place. Self-service data processing tools may be useful if they provide intelligent services for matching data attributes from distinct databases and intelligently integrating them. The data is then arranged to better represent a specific pattern. Lastly, the data is divided into two sets: one for training the algorithm and one for analysis. There are three types of machine learning; supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. The most common of the bunch is supervised machine learning; which is based on accurately labeled data. The machine is given a collection of information, including the outcome of the operation. The rest of the information is referred to as ‘input features’, which ‘supervises’ the machine by guiding it to establish the connections between the variants. In the case of unsupervised learning, the machine isn’t given labeled sets of data to be divided into, allowing it to recognize and create its own patterns within the information provided. Since computers have the capabilities of identifying distinguished similarities, this method helps with the classifying of such data. Reinforcement learning comprises experience-based learning. Similar to people, they learn due to a reward and punishment system based on their actions. These variations of system learning have recently been integrated into business and finance, which is elaborated on in the following passages. There are many ways in which machine learning is used in finance and banking. The most common place it is used is to detect any frauds. Fraud is the most common problem in financial service companies and it accounts for billions of dollars in misfortune each year. The most common frauds are credit or debit card usage by a stranger, document forgery, and mortgage fraud. Usually, finance companies keep an enormous amount of their data stored online, and it increases the risk of information being accessed without authorization. With expanding innovative headway, misrepresentation in the monetary business is currently viewed as a high danger to significant information. Fraud recognition frameworks in the past were planned dependent on a bunch of rules, which could be effortlessly be bypassed by current fraudsters. Therefore, most companies today leverage machine learning to combat fraudulent financial transactions.  Machine learning works by looking over enormous informational indexes to distinguish unique or suspicious activities for additional examination by security groups. It works by looking at an exchange against other information focuses – like the client’s record history, IP address, area, and so forth.  Depending on the type of exchange taking place, the program can automatically refuse a withdrawal or purchase until the person makes a decision. Examples of fraud detection software used by banks include Feedzai, Data visor, and Teradata Machine learning is also used in algorithmic trading, portfolio management, loan underwriting, chatbots, and improving customer service. Algorithmic trading is an interaction for executing orders using computerized and pre-modified exchanging guidelines to represent factors like value, timing, and volume. An algorithm is a set of directions for solving a problem. Computer calculations send little parts of the full request to the market over the long run. In contrast to human dealers, algorithmic exchanging can investigate enormous volumes of information every day and therefore make thousands of trades every day. Machine learning settles on quick exchanging choices, which gives human traders a benefit over the market normal. Likewise, algorithmic exchanging doesn’t settle on exchanging choices dependent on feelings, which is a typical constraint among human dealers whose judgment might be influenced by feelings or individual desires. The exchanging technique is generally utilized by multifaceted investment administrators and monetary foundations to automate trading activities. In the banking industry, organizations access a large number of shopper information, with which machine learning can be prepared to work in order to simplify the underwriting process. Machine learning calculations can settle on speedy choices on endorsing and credit scoring, and save organizations both time and monetary assets that are utilized by people. Data scientists can train algorithms on how to analyze millions of consumer data to coordinate with information records, search for interesting special cases, and settle on a choice on whether a shopper meets all requirements for an advance or protection. For instance, the calculation can be prepared on the most proficient method to examine shopper information, like age, pay, occupation, and the buyer’s credit conduct. As with any form of revolutionary technology, the usage of machine learning has been debated over as its beneficial properties have been weighed against the possible disadvantages. It’s been observed that upon correct usage, it may be used to solve a wide range of business challenges and anticipate complicated customer behavior. We’ve also seen several of the largest IT conglomerates, such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, introduce Cloud Machine Learning platforms. In terms of business, ML can aid businesses by identifying consumer’s demands and formulate a pattern based on them; allowing companies to reach out to such consumers and maximize their sales. It eliminates the need for expenses on some maintenance by reducing the risks associated with unexpected breakdowns and minimizes wasteful costs to the firms.  Historical data, a process visualization tool, a flexible analytical environment, and a feedback loop may all be used to build an ML architecture. The input of data is another agitating chore for businesses in the present, which is where machine learning can step in for manual labor. This eradicates the possibility of errors caused by manual labor causing disruptions and provides employees with extra time to handle other tasks. In the financial sector, machine learning is already utilized for portfolio management, algorithmic trading, loan underwriting, and fraud detection. Chatbots and other conversational interfaces for security, customer support, and sentiment analysis will be among the future uses of ML in banking. Another aspect of business involving artificial intelligence includes image recognition, which entails a system or program that recognizes objects, people, places, and movements in photos. It identifies photographs using an imaging system and machine recognition tech with artificial intelligence and programmed algorithms. With all the benefits of its advancement, machine learning isn’t the most perfect thing. There are several disadvantages which are information acquisition, time and resources and high errors, and wrong interpretations. One of the major hurdles is the amount of finance needed to invest in machine learning for it to be a successful project. More issues have to do with the fact that AI requires gigantic informational indexes to train on, and these ought to be unbiased, and of good quality. There can likewise be times where they have to wait for that new information to be produced. Machine learning needs sufficient opportunity to do the calculations to learn and adequately to satisfy their accuracy and relevancy. It also needs huge resources to work. This can mean extra requirements for the computer to work. Another significant problem is the capacity to precisely decipher the results produced by the calculations. You should likewise cautiously pick the algorithms to get the wanted results. There have been various reports in the past and current years which claim that a significant piece of the human labor force will be replaced via robots and machines in the years to come. With excessive innovative work being led in the field of computerized reasoning, many dread that a significant job crisis will unfurl since numerous positions are all the more precisely and productively performed with the use of machines. In countries like Japan, mainly computer programs and AI is used in the secondary and tertiary sectors. From cleaning the house to depositing money in banks, everything is done by AI. However, AI cannot replace humans in the future. Humans have several capabilities which, even after several technological advancements a machine would not be able to have. These capabilities include creative thinking and creative problem solving, and human connection. For example, when a child goes to a doctor to get an injection, a nurse always relaxes the child to not be afraid of the needle. A machine’s touch would not be able to soothe a child. Another example could be how humans tend to share things with each other and be open about it, a machine will not be able to do so since it is only programmed to things it has been told to do. Like computers, AI will not replace us but would however complement us to make daily work easier and less time-consuming. Without humans themselves, there is no future for AI.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/will-machine-replace-the-human-in-the-future-of-work/", "title": "Will Machine Replace The Human in the Future of Work? | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "“Anything that could give rise to smarter-than-human intelligence – in the form of Artificial Intelligence, brain-computer interfaces, or neuroscience-based human intelligence enhancement – wins hands down beyond contest as doing the most to change the world. Nothing else is even in the same league.”  There’s no denying robots and automation are increasingly part of our daily lives. Just look around the grocery store, or the highway, they are everywhere. This makes us wonder what if AI can replace human intelligence? What can we do to make ourselves relevant tomorrow? Let us try to find the answers to all these questions and more. Let’s first understand what is Artificial Intelligence –  or AI basically machines displaying intelligence. This can be seen from a machine playing chess or a robot answering questions on Facebook. Artificial Intelligence can be further broken down into many different types. There are AIs designed to do specific tasks, such as detecting a specific type of cancer. However, there are also AIs that can do multiple tasks, such as driving a car. There are many types of AIs. Among the top, most important fields are Machine Learning or ML, Neural Network, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing or NLP.  is the idea of machines being able to prove themselves similar to how a human being learns a new skill. Machine Learning also allows for the optimization of an existing skill. Machine Learning is used in many different fields and one such application is entertainment. Netflix uses Machine Learning to recommend more shows that you can watch based on the shows that you have already seen.  are algorithms that are modeled after the human brain. These algorithms think just like we do which can thereby give similar results to what a human being can give. Artificial Neural Networks are used in medical fields to diagnose cancers like lung cancer and prostate cancer.  is the idea that computers have visions. This allows them to see things the way human beings do or potentially better than human beings do, depending on the programming, camera used, etc. Computer Vision is used in autonomous vehicles for navigation from one place to another.  is the idea that computers can listen to what we say. An example of this is  . Siri is able to listen to our demands, process what it means, and provide you an answer based on what is researched. AIs allow for the automation of jobs, thereby replacing what humans already do. This means more job loss and the concentration of wealth to the selected few people. This could mean a destabilization of society and social unrest. In addition to social unrest, AI improves over time. This means it becomes smarter, faster, and cheaper to implement and it will be better at doing repetitive things that humans currently do, such as preparing fast food. It is predicted that AI will improve so much over 50 to 100 years that AI will become super intelligent. This means that it will become even smarter than the most intelligent human on earth. According to many experts such as Elon Musk, this could cause the end of human civilization. AI could potentially start a war against humans, burn crops and do all sorts of tragedies once reserved for human functions. At that point, in theory, we can not stop it because AI would have already thought of all the obstacles that will prevent its goal. This means that we cannot unplug the machine, in effect AI will replace human intelligence. NO! The field of Artificial Intelligence is sophisticated enough to do many human tasks that humans currently do. Currently, AI is not smart enough to be empathetic to humans and cannot think strategically enough to solve complex problems. AI solutions can be expensive and have to go through many different tests and standards to implement. It also takes time for AI to improve. For example, Boston Dynamics, one of the world’s top robotics company had a robot in 2009 that needed assistance to walk. Fast forward to 2019, not only the robot could walk by itself but it could jump over objects, do backflips and so much more. In addition to the timing, it takes time for the price of any new technological solution to drop to a point where it is affordable. For example, a desktop computer costs around $1000 in 1999 but now you can get a significantly more powerful laptop for the exact same price. AI will go through the same curve. But what happens after those 10 to 30 years? Will AI make human intelligence obsolete? Maybe. As we have proven earlier AI will become faster better and cheaper. As this happens, more and more companies will use AI technology to automate more and more jobs to save money, increase productivity, and most importantly, stay competitive. As we have demonstrated, AI will become better through repetition via the use of machine learning. The only difference is that AI will be able to learn faster as time progresses due to the amount of data that is available today. It will also be able to learn from other machines or similar machines to learn how to optimize its tasks or new important skills. However, AI also just not do repetitive and routine tasks better, it will also be able to understand emotional intelligence, ethics, and creativity. This seen in three distinct example- IBM uses its IBM Watson to program the AI to create a movie trailer. Fox approached IBM and said they have a movie coming out on AI #Scifi horror. They asked IBM if their platform IBM Watson could a trailer by reviewing and watching the footage and searching for scary, Sad or happy or other moments in the movie that provoked quality emotions based on how the machine was programmed to identify such emotions in a quantifiable manner. IBM Watson was able to generate a trailer for the movie Morgan. The result, a movie trailer created by machines e IN 2018 google demonstrated an AI assistance that could take calls and do simple stuff. The AI was able to set up an appointment! What was more fascinating was that it was able to understand the nuances of the conversation. The receptionist thought it was a human being that was calling her. That is a very primitive version of what is possible with this technology. Eventually, it will be able to have conversations just as human beings do, making many sales jobs obsolete. example – AI generated art In 2018, a Paris art collective consisting of three students used artificial intelligence to generate a portrait. It generated the portrait painting by studying a set of fifteen thousand art images on wiki art. It was estimated to be worth between seven thousand to ten thousand dollars. The painting sold at an auction for four thirty-five thousand US dollars. However, we cannot for sure say that AI will replace human intelligence. This is because we as a society have started asking hard questions and questioning ethics. Elon Musk founded Open AI, a research lab whose whole purpose is to promote and discover artificial intelligence in a way to benefits humanity. In addition to this, there are many factors that affect the long-term outcome of AI replacing human intelligence. Like, to what degree will other humans allow for AI to take over? Depending on the field, do people even want Artificial Intelligence to help them? Or will they prefer a human counterpart? While we may not be able to control what happens in the long run, we can definitely secure our short-term future. The ability to think outside the box is very human. There are thousands upon thousands of slightly different possible outcomes that may result from every distinguishable action that the human mind with its ability to judge from experience is programmed for these purposes in a far more sophisticated manner than AI can currently achieve. As the billionaire founder of Alibaba, Jack Ma famously said – “AI has logic, human beings have wisdom”. With our understanding of the complexities of human-related processes and our ability to improvise and judge, we are far better equipped to deal with conflicts than robots are ever likely to be. AI may be able to recognize faces and images but it can rarely successfully read the feelings of those faces. Humans, to lesser or greater degrees, are capable of an accurate analysis of emotional subtext. With the application of intuition and the use of delicately worded or elusive languages, through these methods, we are able to properly judge how a person Robots and computers function well when presented with quantifiable data. However, once the situation enters a gray area, whether this term refers to morals, processes, or definitions robots are more likely to falter. Humans are capable of responding to more indicators of quality than computers are. While an AI system may be able to analyze documents according to the true or false statements made within the text, we can judge whether or not it is well written and analyze the implication of the use of certain words and the overall meaning of the content.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/what-if-the-creation-is-taking-over-the-creator/", "title": "What if the Creation is Taking Over the Creator? | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "Human minds, a fascination in itself carrying the potential of tinkering nature with the pixie dust intelligence, creating and solving the mysteries and wonders with anything but admiration. However, no matter how captivating a human mind can be, it could sometimes be appalled. It could be the hunger or maybe the desire to want more, to go beyond and unravel the limitations, or maybe something like pure greed. Humans have never stopped and always keep evolving when it comes to intelligence and this is what makes them the supreme. Intelligence calls out for supremacy and so, what if there was to evolve something that opposed a challenge to the very human minds, to their capabilities while making them question their own importance among themselves? Artificial Intelligence came as a revolution, havoc when it first came to the light. The concept of making machines does work on their own, like granting machines –The Intelligence. The idea of making machines work like humans came back in the 19s. Back then people didn’t believe in such a thing as making a non-living thing work, think, and carry tasks on its own, not to mention, to actually surpass humans themselves in those skills. The facts are it did. By 1997. The greatest chess player, Garry Kasparov was defeated in a chess game by a machine and this is where exactly, a top skilled human lost to a mere machine created by another who by himself could’ve never defeated him. It was a rule of power, of betterment, of skills, and the granted supremacy. Were AI and Machines just tools? Equipment?  Something that helped an unskilled person with his mind and intelligence creates something that could do the skilled work for him with perfection and precision? Well initially it was, however, as time passed as humans got drawn to the puzzle of AI, a lot changed. Human research went deeper and deeper and as a result, the machines evolved with it. At present, AI & Machines is a growing field. As it develops and improves, it has become a part of the industrial revolution. In industries, most of the laborious work that was once taken care of by humans was now replaced by machines. Naturally, with the evolution in machines, its precision, mass productivity, quality control, time efficiencies, and all the other factors made it a better choice. A choice over humans. This led to fear, a fear of a not-so-distant future, a future where maybe machines will be so evolved that they’ll take over the need of a human employee leading to unemployment. With the population increase around the world, it became the new tech threat for the labor market. Then again… how true is it? Does AI really oppose a threat? Will adapting to technology make millions of people lose their jobs? Will it lead to mass unemployment? Will the machines really surpass humans? Will, the creation take over the creator? No matter how fearful the future with AI may seem, in reality, it is not that scary. Truth is AI is the present reality, it is the key that holds the power to unlock a whole next level of human evolution. Technology is growing. There was a time where technology was just an idea, but today that idea has been implemented, it’s working and is carried out. Nobody could stop the advancement and growth of Artificial Intelligence, it’s a wave that is already flowing and we as the present generation and the generations to come to have to learn, to learn to swim in this flow and avoid drowning. Many jobs will be replaced by machines, as AI evolves it’ll keep challenging human minds and their skills. With the present COVID 19 situation, contactless cashiers to robots delivering packages have already taken over the usual routine tasks. The jobs of Secretaries, Schedulers, and book-keeper are at risk too. Manufacturing units, agriculture, food services, retail, transportation & logistic, and hospitality are all a part of the AI-affected automation. At an estimation, it is said that around 20 million jobs, especially including manufacturing will be lost to robots. As AI, robotics, 3D printing, and genetics make their way in, even the architects, medical docs, and music composers feel threatened by technology. Making us question that will AI even edge us out of our brain jobs too? Now that can be terrifying. However, as much as machines will be replacing few jobs, they’ll also be creating new jobs.  With the economic growth, innovation, and investment around 133 million jobs are said to be generated. These newly enhanced jobs are to create benefits and amplify one’s creativity, strategy, and entrepreneurial skills. So what is the catch? Well, it’s the skills. Even though AI is creating 3 times more jobs than it is destroying, it’s the skills that count. AI surged in new job opportunities, opportunities like Senior Data Scientist, Mobile Application Developer, and SEO specialist. These jobs were once never heard of but now with AI it’s born, however, to do these jobs or for its qualification, one needs high-level skills and to acquire those skills can be an expensive and time-consuming task. The future generation might be able to cope up with it but the real struggle is to be faced by the present two generations. It’s the vulnerability between the skill gap and unemployment and the youths are the ones to be crushed the most. Therefore, as the advancement of AI becomes inevitable there remains no choice but to adapt, learn, equip ourselves and grow with it. The companies have to work together to build an AI-ready workplace. They should collaborate with the government, educators, and non-profit organizations and work together to bring out policies that could help understand the technologies’ impacts faster while also providing the employees some security. The economic and business planning should be made considerable for minimizing the impact on local jobs and properly maximizing the opportunities. The employees should be provided with proper tools to carry along with the new opportunities while acquiring AI-based skills for their day-to-day work. New skills should be identified and implemented for the upskilling and continual learning initiatives. Employees will have to maximize their Robotic Quotient and learn core skills. They’ll have to adapt to new working models and understand their roles in the coming future.  Howsoever, it’s not like AI will totally take over control, even though AI proves to be a better choice, it still has its limitations at present. First, it’s expensive, secondly, manufacturing machines in bulk is not good for the environment. Machines are also very high maintenance, therefore human labor will often come cheaper and so will be considered over machines. Underdeveloped countries will find it hard to equip their people with the upskilling and reskilling required for AI workplace and so for AI to play a role in those countries, might take years. AI can also be risky and unethical, as it’s hard to figure out who to be held responsible for in cases where an AI went wrong. No matter, how advanced AI gets, there are some skills where humans will always have an upper hand i.e., soft skills. Skills like teamwork, communication, creativity, and critical thinking are something that AI hasn’t been able to beat us up to yet and so the value of creativity, leadership, and emotional intelligence has increased. Although, with machines coming in between humans causing the lack of human-to-human interaction, the humans seem to fade away a little. With this era, comes the need for good leaders. Leaders who are capable of handling both machines and humans together, the ones who are organized enough to manage the skilled and the unskilled employees while providing the unskilled trainees with proper training. Leaders who hold profound soft skills and encourage teamwork while working along with machines. The ones who are patient, calm, and optimized.   In conclusion, yes AI and machines are going to be very challenging but there’s nothing humans haven’t overcome. Adaptation and up-gradation are going to be the primary factor for survival. As we witness the onset of the 4th industrial revolution, let’s buckle up our seats and race along the highway with the essential fuels (skills) so as to not let ourselves eliminated. After all, this is an unending race with infinity as the end, all we could do is try not to run out of fuel. Try not to be outdated.  We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/ai-in-healthcare-to-improve-patient-outcomes/", "title": "AI in healthcare to Improve Patient Outcomes | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "“If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades, it will be a highly infectious virus rather than a war. Not missiles but microbes.” Bill Gates’s remarks at a TED conference in 2014, right after the world had avoided the Ebola outbreak. When the new, unprecedented, invisible virus hit us, it met an overwhelmed and unprepared healthcare system and oblivious population. This public health emergency demonstrated our lack of scientific consideration and underlined the alarming need for robust innovations in our health and medical facilities. For the past few years, artificial intelligence has proven to be of tangible potential in the healthcare sectors, clinical practices, translational medical and biomedical research. After the first case was detected in China on December 31st 2019, it was an AI program developed by BlueDot that alerted the world about the pandemic. It was quick to realise AI’s ability to analyse large chunks of data could help in detecting patterns and identifying and tracking the possible carriers of the virus. Many tracing apps use AI to keep tabs on the people who have been infected and prevent the risk of cross-infection by using AI algorithms that can track patterns and extract some features to classify or categorise them. IBM Watson, a sophisticated AI that works on cloud computing and natural language processing, has prominently contributed to the healthcare sector on a global level. Being a conversational AI, since 2013, Watson has helped in recommending treatments to patients suffering from cancer to ensure that they get the best treatment at optimum costs. Researchers at Google Inc. showed that an AI system can be trained on thousands of images to achieve physician-level sensitivity. By identifying the molecular patterns associated with disease status and its subtypes, gene expression, and protein abundance levels, machine learning methods can detect fatal diseases like cancer at an early stage. Machine Learning (ML) techniques focus mainly on analyzing structured data, which can further help in clustering patients’ traits and infer the probability of disease outcomes. Since patient traits mainly include masses of data relating to age, gender, disease history, disease-specific data like diagnostic imaging and gene expressions, etc, ML can extract features from these data inputs by constructing data analytical algorithms. ML algorithms are either supervised or unsupervised. Unsupervised learning helps in extracting features and clustering similar features together that further leads to early detection of diseases. Clustering and principal component analysis enable grouping or clustering of similar traits together that are further used to maximize or minimize the similarity between the patients within or between the clusters. Since patient traits are recorded in multiple dimensions, such as genes, principal component analysis(PCA) creates the apparatus to reduce these dimensions which humans could have not done alone. Supervised learning considers the outcomes of the subjects together with the traits, and further correlates the inputs with the outputs to predict the probability of getting a particular clinical event, expected value of a disease level or expected survival time, or risk of Down’s syndrome. Biomarker panels that are mostly used to detect ovarian cancer, have outperformed the conventional statistical methods due to machine learning. In addition to this, the use of EHRs and Bayesian networks, which are a part of supervised machine learning algorithms, can predict clinical outcomes and mortality respectively. Unstructured data such as clinical notes and texts are converted into machine-readable structured data with the help of natural language processing(NLP). NLP works with two components: text processing and classification. Text processing helps in identifying a series of disease-relevant keywords in clinical notes and then through classification are further categorized into normal and abnormal cases. Chest screening through ML and NLP has helped find abnormalities in the lungs and provide treatment to covid patients. Healthcare organizations use NLP-based chatbots to increase interactions with patients, keeping their mental health and wellness in check. Deep learning is a modern extension of the classical neural network techniques which helps explore more complex non-linear patterns in data, using algorithms like convolution neural network, recurrent neural network, deep belief network, and deep neural network which enables more accurate clinical prediction. When it comes to genome interpretation, deep neural networks surpass the conventional methods of logistics regression and support vector machines. Sepsis Watch is an AI system trained in deep learning algorithms that holds the capability to analyze over 32 million data points to create a patient’s risk score and identify the early stages of sepsis. Another method known as the Learning-based Optimization of the Under Sampling Pattern( LOUPE) is based on integrating full resolution MRI scans with the convolutional neural network algorithm, which helps in creating more accurate reconstructions. Robotic surgery is widely considered in most delicate surgeries like gynaecology and prostate surgery. Even after striking the right balance between human decisions and AI precision, robotic surgery reduces surgeon efficiency as they have to be manually operated through a console. Thus, autonomous robotic surgery is on the rise with inventions such as robotic silicon fingers that mimic the sense of touch that surgeons need to identify organs, cut tissues, etc., or robotic catheters that can navigate whether it is touching blood, tissue, or valve. Researchers at Children’s National Hospital, Washington have already developed an AI called Smart Tissue Autonomous Robot (STAR), which performs a colon anastomosis on its own with the help of an ML-powered suturing tool, that automatically detects the patient’s breathing pattern to apply suture at the correct point. Cloud computing in healthcare has helped in retrieving and sharing medical records safely with a reduction in maintenance costs. Through this technology doctors and various healthcare workers have access to detailed patient data that helps in speeding up analysis ultimately leading to better care in the form of more accurate information, medications, and therapies. Since AI can analyze literature beyond readability, it can be used to concise biomedical research. With the help of ML algorithms and NLP, AI can accelerate screening and indexing of biomedical research, by ranking the literature of interest which allows researchers to formulate and test scientific hypotheses far more precisely and quickly. Taking it to the next level, AI systems like the computational modelling assistant (CMA) helps researchers to construct simulation models from the concepts they have in mind. Such innovations have majorly contributed to topics such as tumour suppressor mechanisms and protein-protein interaction information extraction. Since precision medicine focuses on healthcare interventions to individuals or groups of patients based on their profile, the various AI devices pave the way to practice it more efficiently. With the help of ML, complex algorithms like large datasets can be used to predict and create an optimal treatment strategy. Deep learning and neural networks can be used to process data in healthcare apps and keep a close watch on the patient’s emotional state, food intake, or health monitoring.  “Omics” refers to the collective technologies that help in exploring the roles, relationships of various branches ending with the suffix “omics” such as genomics, proteomics, etc. Omics-based tests based on machine learning algorithms help find correlations and predict treatment responses, ultimately creating personalized treatments for individual patients.  For psychologists studying creativity,  AI is promising new classes of experiments that are developing data structures and programs and exploring novel theories on a new horizon. Studies show that  AI can conduct therapy sessions,   sessions, and assessments autonomously, also assisting human practitioners before, during, or after sessions. The Detection and Computational Analysis of Psychological Signal project uses ML, computer vision, and NLP to analyze language, physical gestures, and social signals to identify cues for human distress. This ground-breaking technology assesses soldiers returning from combat and recognizes those who require further mental health support. In the future, it will combine data captured during face-to-face interviews with information on sleeping, eating, and online behaviours for a complete patient view. Stroke is another frequently occurring disease that affects more than 500 million people worldwide. Thrombus,  in the vessel cerebral infarction is the major (about 85%) cause of stroke occurrence. In recent years, AI techniques have been used in numerous stroke-related studies as early detection and timely treatment along with efficient outcome prediction can help solve the problem. With AI at our disposal, large amounts of data with rich information, more complications and real-life clinical questions can be addressed in this arena. Currently, two ML algorithms- genetic fuzzy finite state machine and PCA were implemented to build a model building solution. These include a human activity recognition stage and a stroke onset detection stage. An alert stroke message is activated as soon as a movement significantly different from the normal pattern is recorded. ML methods have been applied to neuroimaging data to assist disease evaluation and predicting stroke treatment for the diagnosis. Today, the market for AI-based patient monitoring is impressive and monetarily enticing. It is evolving with artificial sensors, smart technologies and explores everything from brain-computer interfaces to nanorobotics. Companies with their smart-watches have engaged people to perform remote monitoring even when they are not “patients”. An obvious place to start is with wearable and embedded sensors, glucose monitors, pulse monitors, oximeters, and ECG monitors. With patient monitoring becoming crucial, AI finds numerous applications in chronic conditions, intensive care units, operating rooms, emergency rooms, and cardiac wards where timeless clinical decision-making can be measured in seconds. More advances have started to gain traction like smart prosthetics and implants. These play an impeccable role in patient management post-surgery or rehabilitation. Demographics, laboratory results and vital signs can also be used to predict cardiac arrest, transfer into the intensive care unit, or even death. In addition, an interpretable machine-learning model can assist anesthesiologists in predicting hypoxaemia events during surgery. This suggests that with deep-learning algorithms, raw patient-monitoring data could be better used to avoid information overload and alert overload while enabling more accurate clinical prediction and timely decision-making. Considering the vast range of tasks that an AI can do, it is evident that it holds deep potential in improving patient outcomes to skyrocketing levels. Using sophisticated algorithms AI can bring a revolution in the healthcare sector. Even after facing challenges like whether the technology will be able to deliver the promises, ethical measures, training physicians to use it, standard regulations etc, the role of AI in transforming the clinical practices cannot be ignored. The biggest challenge is the integration of AI in daily practice. All of these can be overcome and within that period the technologies will mature making the system far more enhanced and effective.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/will-ai-replace-us-or-work-with-us/", "title": "Will AI Replace Us or Work With Us? | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "“Machine intelligence is the last invention that humanity will ever need to make” Nick Bostrom To put it frankly, Artificial Intelligence will eventually replace jobs. Workers in a variety of industries, from healthcare to agriculture and manufacturing, should expect to witness hiring disruptions as a result of Artificial Intelligence. If history has taught us anything, it is that disruptive paradigm-shifting business ideas not only make a fortune for the innovators, but they also build the groundwork for new business models, market entrants, and job opportunities which will inevitably follow. It is true that robots today or in future will eventually replace humans for many jobs, but so did innovative farming equipment for humans and horses during the industrial revolution. But that does not mean that our jobs as humans will end here. We, on the other hand, will be required to generate and provide value in whole new ways for entirely new business models as a result of these changes. According to 71% of the businesses worldwide, Artificial Intelligence can help people overcome critical and challenging problems and live better lives. Artificial Intelligence consultants at work will be more or equally fair, according to a whopping 83% of corporate leaders. These results demonstrate that Artificial Intelligence is steadily extending its measures, yielding societal benefits and allowing citizens to live more fulfilling lives. Since the advent of Industry 4.0, businesses are moving at a fast pace towards automation, be it any type of industry. In 2013, researchers at oxford university did a study on the future of work. They concluded that almost one in every two jobs have a high risk of being automated by machines. Machine learning is responsible for this disruption. It is the most powerful branch of artificial intelligence. It allows machines to learn from data and mimic some of the things that humans can do. A research was conducted by the employees of Kaggle wherein an algorithm was to be created to take images of a human eye and diagnose an eye disease known as diabetic retinopathy. Here, the winning algorithm could match the diagnosis given by human ophthalmologists. Another study was conducted wherein an algorithm should be created to grade high school essays. Here too, the winning algorithm could match the grade given by human teachers. Thus, we can safely conclude that given the right data, machines can easily outperform human beings in tasks like these. A teacher might read 10,000 essays over a 40-year career; an ophthalmologist might see 50,000 eyes but a machine can read a million essays and see a million eyes within minutes. Thus, it is convenient to conclude that we have no chance of competing with machines on frequent, high volume tasks.  But there are tasks where human beings have an upper hand, and that is, in novel tasks. Machines can’t handle things they haven’t seen many times before. The fundamental rule of machine learning is that it learns from large volumes of past data. But humans don’t; we have the ability of seemingly connecting disparate threads to solve problems we haven’t seen before.  Percy Spencer was a physicist working on radar during world war 2 where he noticed that the magnetron was melting his chocolate bar. Here, he was able to connect his understanding of electromagnetic radiation with his knowledge of cooking in order to invent the microwave oven. Now this sort of cross pollination happens to each one of us several times in a day. Thus, machines cannot compete with us when it comes to tackling novel situations.  Now as we all know that around 92% of talented professionals believe that soft skills such as human interactions and fostering relationships matter much more than hard skills in being successful in managing a workplace. Perhaps, these are the kind of tasks that machines can never compete with humans at.  Also, creative tasks: the copy behind a marketing campaign needs to grab customers’ attention and will have to stand out of the crowd. Business strategy means finding gaps in the market and accordingly working on them. Since machines cannot outperform humans in novel tasks, it will be humans who would be creating these campaigns and strategies.  Human contact would be essential in care-giving and educational-related work responsibilities, and technology would take a backseat. Health screenings and customer service face-to-face communication would advocate for human contact, with Artificial Intelligence playing a supporting role.  So, what does this mean for the future of work? The future state of any single job lies in the answer to one single question: to what extent is the job reducible to tackling frequent high-volume tasks and to what extent does it involve tackling novel situations? Today machines diagnose diseases and grade exam papers, over the coming years they’re going to conduct audits, they’re going to read boilerplate from legal contracts. But does that mean we’re not going to be needing accountants and lawyers? Wrong. We’re still going to need them for complex tax structuring, for path breaking litigation. It will only get tougher to get these jobs as machine learning will shrink their ranks.  Amazon has recruited more than 100,000 robots in its warehouses to help move goods and products around more effectively, and its warehouse workforce has expanded by more than 80,000 people. Humans pick and pack goods (Amazon has over 480,000,000 products on its “shelves”), while robots move orders throughout the enormous warehouses, therefore reducing “the amount of walking required of workers, making Amazon pickers more efficient and less exhausted.” Furthermore, because Amazon no longer requires aisle space for humans, the robots enable Amazon to pack shelves together like cars in rush-hour traffic.” More inventory under one roof offers better selection for customers, and a higher density of shelf space equals more inventory under one roof. Kodak, once an undisputed giant of the photography industry, had a 90% share in the USA market in 1976, and by 1984, they were employing 1,45,000 people. But in the year 2012, they had a net worth of negative $1 billion and they had to declare bankruptcy. Why? Because they failed to predict the importance of exponential trends when it comes to technology. On the other hand, Instagram, a digital photography company started in 2012 with 13 employees and later they were sold to Facebook for $1 billion. This is so ironic because Kodak pioneered digital photography and actually invented the first digital camera but unfortunately thought of it as a mere product and didn’t pay attention towards it and this created the problem.   We live in an era of artificial intelligence (AI), which has given us tremendous computing power, storage space, and information access. We were given the spinning wheel in the first, electricity in the second, and computers in the third industrial revolution by the exponential growth of technology. Airbnb, which is a giant start-up and is known for enabling homeowners to rent out their homes and couches to travellers, for example, “is now creating a new Artificial Intelligence system that will empower its designers and product engineers to literally take ideas from the drawing board and convert them into actual products almost instantly.” This might be a significant breakthrough whether you’re a designer, engineer, or other type of technologist.   There are three key changes that automation can bring about at the macro level:  Artificial Intelligence isn’t just a fad. Tractica, a market research firm, published a report in 2016 that predicted “annual global revenue for artificial intelligence products and services will expand from 643.7 million in 2016 to $36.8 billion by 2025, a 57-fold increase over that time span.” As a result, it is the IT industry’s fastest-growing segment of any size.” The reduction in need for people as a result of Artificial Intelligence and related technologies, which resulted in job layoffs, was a cause of fear. In India alone, job losses in the IT sector have reportedly reached 1,000 in the last year, owing to the integration of new and advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning.  Most of the IT companies such as Infosys, Wipro, TCS, and Cognizant have reduced their employee base in India and are recruiting less, while engaging more personnel in the United States and investing heavily in “centres of innovation.” Artificial Intelligence and data science, which are currently the trending aspects that require fewer people and are primarily located abroad, aren’t helping the prospects of local employees. Another factor is that the computer industry is continuously growing and would develop to a size of two million workers. Unfortunately, it’s a drop in the bucket compared to what robots are doing to Information Technology’s less-skilled brothers.  Large e-commerce sites that used to be operated by armies of people are now manned by 200 robots produced by GreyOrange, which is an Indian company based out in Gurgaon. These indefatigable robots lift and stack boxes 24 hours a day, with only a 30-minute break for recharging, and have cut employees by up to 80%. For efficiency, this is a victory but a disaster for job prospects.  Internal re-skilling and redeployment of staff is a critical requirement of the hour. Artificial intelligence has presented Indian policymakers with epistemological, scientific, and ethical issues. This requires us to abandon regular, linear, and non-disruptive mental patterns. The tale of artificial intelligence’s influence on individuals and their occupations will only be told over time. It is up to us to upskill ourselves and look for ways to stay current with the industry’s current trends and demands.  So, will machines be able to take over many of our jobs? The answer is a resounding yes. However, for every job that is taken over by robots, there will be an equal number of positions available for people to do. Some of these human vocations will be artistic in nature. Others will necessitate humans honing superhuman cognitive abilities. Humans and machines can form symbiotic relationships, assisting each other in doing what they do best. In the future, people and machines may be able to collaborate and work together towards a common goal for any business they work for.  We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

When it comes to storytelling, many brands struggle with shaping their story into a rewarding and mutually beneficial engagement with their high-value audiences. In order for data analytics to reveal its potential to add value to the business, a certain number of ingredients need to be in place. This is particularly true in recent times with the explosion of big data (big implying data volume, velocity, and variety). Common Problems that company Face in marketing Analyse are    We measure the effectiveness and reach of your marketing campaigns. It answers questions including how many people saw, clicked on, and converted from various marketing channels. It can show you an overall view of your campaigns, or get more granular to pinpoint exactly which campaigns have garnered the most success. The answer is hidden in the data flowing to your brand story, exposed through the science and craft of attribution While many organizations use traditional rules-based attribution which works well for simple analysis some require more complex analysis. This is where algorithmic attribution becomes a powerful tool. The big company uses machine learning and advanced statistics to more objectively assign credit across all those touchpoints and ensure you are accurately assessing the value of your marketing efforts. Conduct an experiment to test hypotheses and also to catch patterns to prove or disapprove theories surrounding the success of your marketing efforts. This is especially useful when similar campaigns show starkly different results from previous runs. You can experiment with everything from web copy and design, to publishing outlet and publication time. The most important thing to remember is not to be afraid to test things out before you commit– if you’re investing a lot of money in a campaign, experimenting a bit will ensure that you get the best ROI. Test multiple versions of your web pages, including a web designer to help you change the page layout for each test, giving you results on how each variation performed. The heat mapping feature gives you data about where your customers are spending the most time, going as far as giving numerical aggregate click data of the number of people that clicked on different elements of your site. Collect data from the web and by your experimentation on every aspect of the Market. Not all marketers are data scientists, so your marketing analytics have to make sense. Data visualization allows business users to quickly identify trends, anomalies, and patterns within your analytics dashboards and reports. Provide Workspace, for example, allows you to build the visualizations that will help drive engagement. You can create dashboards that suit your specific business needs and reports that clearly define your successes. Freeform Analysis within Analysis Workspace allows you to create custom analysis views.  Real-time data reveals real-time interest. You’ll know which content customers are looking at and what drives them to buy at that critical moment in time. Once you know what’s working to drive more conversions, you can optimize your website and marketing campaigns based on those results. You’ll want to start spending money in places where you’re seeing the biggest ROI; you’ll want to make improvements to your site based on how people are behaving and what they’re commonly looking for. You can optimize every part of your online marketing process so that customers have a good user experience while also converting. To get a complete view of content engagement we combine OTT analytics with Quality of Experience (QoE) metrics. You can see how video content drives viewer behavior, revealing opportunities for ad monetization. Marketing analytics allows you to quickly build and deliver video experiences to targeted audiences based upon common characteristics, such as age and viewing frequency. It will help you separate the proverbial casual shoppers from the qualified leads, it also gives you details about your customers so that you can separate them into buckets and target them accordingly. These groups can consider anything from demographic info to past shopping behaviors, to web usage patterns in order to make meaningful subsets out of your customers.  As leads convert to customers, the path leading them to conversion becomes incredibly valuable for a marketer focused on leveraging predictive analytics. That information, called behavioral data, means fairly little alone. When combined with demographic (or firmographic, in the case of B2B companies) data, it empowers marketing teams to identify commonalities and trends that help create new target segments.  deviate slightly in that they focus specifically on tracking specific buying trends among target demographics. For B2C customers, this has a fairly obvious application. Customers who buy similar items can all be prompted with the same promotional information. For B2B customers, the use case actually expands a bit. As you will see with a deeper dive into “recommendations” later in the piece, these product-based clusters also help marketing technologists accurately forecast the lifetime value of a customer? By developing your own computer model, you can still work within your means to make smart predictions about customers. Similar to segmentation, predictive modeling lets you drill down to an even more granular level to identify your customers and target them with the right marketing campaigns that will nudge them to make a purchase. Giving more personalized recommendations, you can use historical purchase and demographic data to identify your sales or usage cycles and then target users based on when they’re more likely to purchase a product or service. By using some of our predictive marketing tool that uses data to give you a comprehensive insight into who your most promising customers are, and how best to target them next. That can collect and digs up data from other software tools like your CRM and marketing automation software so that you can act on insights and pinpoint the hottest leads. With those insights, you can react to what’s happening in the blink of an eye and adapt your marketing to get a better response. Storytelling is the often-forgotten step in the marketing analytics process. Collecting data is great, but it’s pretty useless unless you can explain it. Interpreting data can be somewhat of a creative process, but it’ll be infinitely easier when you can see the entire set of data and the factors that affected it in order to be able to provide a coherent narrative to your data. With insights from marketing analytics, you can then rely on tools for optimization, targeting, and audience management to drive your best story forward. Data can then be turned into dashboards and graphs that show the overall performance of marketing efforts across multiple channels. You can also drill down to individual campaigns in order to get a comparative look at campaign performance and make decisions about the overall marketing strategy based on these reports.

This virus\ncauses respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever,\nand in more severe cases, difficulty in breathing or may cause lung disease.\nSenior Citizens or people under some medical treatment are more likely to\nacclimate to this virus. The impact of this\noutbreak is rapidly increasing at a higher rate than anything else in the\neconomies of various countries of the world. This outbreak is considered a\nsituation like recession or slowdown of the overall economy after the great\nrecession in the year 2008.  India is the\nfifth-largest economy in the world with a population of 133.92 Crores. India is\nstill in its developing phase and its uneven development across regions and\ncommunities adds various complexities in coping up with this kind of pandemic.\nIt also reflects that there is a huge scope for social schism among the people\nof different communities. In India, the first\ncase was reported at the end of January month because people travel from China\nto India. The government of India made special arrangements for the students\nand people who were there in Wuhan for studies and work so that India can save\ntheir people from the effect of this novel coronavirus. The infection rate of\nthis virus is relatively low in India as compared to its population size\nbecause of the rapid actions taken by the government to quarantine people and\nshut borders. Also, the government\nof India announces the suspension of various activities in the country like\nshut down of educational institutes and corporate houses, deferring all tourist\nvisas and postal services, cease all the interstate and intrastate borders\nwithin the country, and terminate all the transportation facilities. The drive\nof social distancing and isolation of infected people also takes place.  The initiatives taken\nby the government of India in accordance with this pandemic outbreak affect the\neconomy in a very drastic way. It changes the way in which the country is\ndeveloping. A lot of disruption is happening all around the nation which\nchallenges the “unimaginably ambitious” aim of the Modi government for\nachieving “$5 Trillion Economy” by 2024. The Indian economy is\ndeemed as the fastest developing economies in the world. India has now emerged\nas a global preeminent player in the world’s economies and at the third-largest\neconomy in terms of purchasing power parity. It consists of numerous sectors or\nchannels such as Hospitality, Education, Retail, E-Commerce, Aviation,\nPetroleum, Banking, Automobiles, Pharma or Healthcare, Insurance, and Railways,\netc. which are going unfavourably influenced by this disruption and through\nwhich the economy is getting affected. The Hotel industry of India has a very vast contribution towards India’s Total Gross Domestic Product. It is the most prominent service sector with market size of $22 Billion in 2019 & the proposed rate of growth by 8.6% till 2025 now becomes a challenge because of this pandemic. The intact turnover of the Indian hospitality sector was sunk between $8.85 billion to $10 billion which reflects depletion of 39% – 45% as correlated to last year’s revenues. The hospitality sector needs to take proactive financial steps to mitigate the impact of COVID 19. It is wholly based on travel, trade, and tourism for its subsistence or existence. This extensive outbreak leads to huge cancellations of bookings in the last months’ leads to the miserable position of hotels in the worrisome declines.  Hotels are\ngrappling from crisis amid stringent government restrictions and also\nemphasizing on isolation and social distancing. The impact is very huge and is\nunpredictable but the sector is at its maturity level and focusing on their\nhospitality commitment to and for the society in the best way they can. The big\nhotel chains in India propose their rooms and venues for free of cost or at\nvery highly subsidized rates to the government for the purpose of quarantine\npeople who came back from abroad and to the medical fraternity to use rooms as\nthe isolation infirmaries. Also, the pantries are used for preparing feeds for\nthe needy ones in a proper sanitized manner.  The industry\nprofessionals have to keep an eye on their rivals to check their surviving\npolicies at this consequence and they have to sustain their public image in the\nmarket after analysing the after-effects on their pricing and preservation of\ntheir assets. This industry may exceed after witnessing remarkable assurance in\nthe economy. Education is a pretty essential aspect\nin an underdeveloped country like India. India’s Education sector proposes a\nglorious opportunity to 29% of India’s population which is between the ages of\n0-14 years. There is a foreseen rise in India’s higher education sector of Rs\n2,44,824 crore by 2025 but as the occurrence of the Virus that’s a troublesome\nchallenge.  The COVID-19 outbreak has set off alarm\nbells across the country for the 250 million school going students along with\nstudents enrolled in universities in India. India’s education sector is not\nunaffected, it has given shut down of school, Colleges and other institutions\nthis is basically for social distancing to prevent the cause-effect of the\nspreading virus and be precaution beforehand of the disruption. India has\nresulted in 49.86% of the increase in internet penetration utilized to remit\nlearning. So to permeate the pauses the virtual classes and online classes are\ncatching the drift i.e. a merge turn to the digital learning platform. In the wake of this dilemma and\ngripping the student safety in mind and their scholarly concern, most of the\ninstitutes have taken the action to accommodate the convenience of\ntelecommunication, Skype call, zoom call and admittance to other virtual\nprospects to fill the gap of learning. The examinations are being suspended or\npostponed keeping the concerns of the burgeoning COVID-19 on the masses\nextensively in the consultation.  Undoubtedly, this is a very crucial\ntime for students. Ironically, it has taken the COVID-19 outbreak to get the\nwhole education sector to slip to digital mode and with both humanistic and\ntechnological support. The impact on education is likely to induce losses in\nterms of dropout rates and learning outcomes, especially in regions with low shock\nresilience. The Coronavirus outbreak had a\ndebilitating influence on India’s travel and tourism sector with the industry\nassessing an overall deterioration of ₹ 5 lakh crore with witnessing a 4-5\ncrore people job cuts. It was also scrutinized that online travel agencies were\nset to suffer as much as  ₹ 4,312 crores, tour operators (inbound and\ndomestic) ₹ 25,000 crores, adventure tour operators nearly ₹ 19,000 crores and\ncruise tourism ₹419 crores. This sector engages employment to the extensive\nsegment of the civilization like miniature homestays and regular wage\nearners.  The time period from December to May is\nvery crucial and important for this sector to attract its customers as people\ncome from outside the country in this time span and also people within the\ncountry travel a lot to spend their summer holidays and also the people who\ntravel abroad. According to ICC, Foreign Tourist Arrivals (FTA) has got fluff\nby about 67% seasonally in January-March, while for domestic tourists, the\nvalue is lower by almost 40%. According to The World Economic Forum\n(WEF), this pandemic is putting up to 50 million jobs in the global Travel and\nTourism sector at risk and out of this, around 30 million would be in Asia.\nIndian Chamber of Commerce (ICC) counsels fixing up of a ‘Travel & Tourism\nStabilisation Fund’ with direct gain transfer to each unit to prevent\ncommercial loss and sequential job loss. It is presumed that it would take up\nto 10 months for the tourism sector to get back to its sustainable level. Travel and Tourism sector bodies had\ncommunicated to the government for interim aid to pay EMIs, instalments, taxes,\nand salaries to operators as the tourism industry is eyeing destitution,\ncessation of industries and mass lay-off. The unskilled people of the industry\nare perceived as the most vulnerable link in the whole industry concatenation. The Indian Banking sector has an\ninfluential pivotal role in the development of an economy as it is considered a\nnecessary service sector in society. India’s banking sector is sufficiently\ncapitalized and well regulated by the regulatory body The Reserve Bank of India\n(RBI). Currently, Indian banking and financial industry is at the fifth-largest\nin the world and has the potential to become third-largest by 2024 and\ncontributing approx 7.7% towards the GDP of India. Although the banking and\nfinancial sector were previously suffering a lot and are on the struggling\nplank because of scams like Nirav Modi, VUCA disruptions like demonetization,\nthe enlightenment of GST in the nation and now with this pandemic. This disruption causes so many problems\nto the retail as well as corporate customers. Indian Banking Association, said\nto bank customers that they should visit the bank branches only in the\nsituation of extreme emergency. The Bank branch cut-offs the working hours in a\nday. Many branches were sanitized under the orders of the state government and\nthe services are kept limited which are most essential in the branches. RBI\nasked customers to use digital platforms for most of the operations and banks\nare operating round-the-clock to assure all digital channels are up to date. However, an appropriate fiscal policy\nresponse should be implemented to uplift the economy from drowsiness to a\nvigorous state. From boosting bank’s liquidity to providing financial relief to\nits customers, RBI announced various guidelines to stabilize the concern of\ncorporate houses as well as MSMEs and retail customers in the wake of this\noutbreak. Banks are now being allowed for a three\nmonths moratorium on payment of instalments regarding all term loans prominent\nas on 01.03.2020. Also, the repayment schedule and tenure of such loans can be\nshifted by 3 months. Further to tackle financially this industry and its\nvaluable customers the RBI also slashed the repo rate by 75 basis points. The Government of India mobilized various committees or task force specifically for COVID-19 and National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to overcome from this pandemic. These committees are here to ensure a harmonized response against this outbreak. The government took all necessary steps to fight against the coronavirus such as introducing a new app for the population named as “AAROGYA SETU APP” which gives essential information about the virus. Such crises also heal the earth back to its natural state with fewer disruptions by humans. It could also be stated that such crises also seed some opportunities in the nation for the better development of the whole economy.

While certain industries like Pharma, Mobile and Web-streaming industries, Fitness and Teleconference apps have boomed during this pandemic, industries like Tourism, Fast-Food Industry, Retail and Leisure sectors have suffered the worst hit due to Coronavirus Impact During this lockdown to prevent the spreading of Coronavirus Impact, almost all of the companies have adopted a work-from-home culture and have used various Teleconference apps to hold meetings. Teleconference apps are also being used by college institutions and universities so that the studies don’t get disrupted. Also, confined to their homes, people have started engaging more in fitness apps, and web streaming services like Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon Prime are at their zenith. While these industries are thriving in this pandemic, the most affected industry during this time is the Hospitality Industry. Hospitality Industry embodies various sectors like transportation, traveling, airlines, hotels, and lodges, etc. Hotels and traveling are also a major part of the Tourism Industry. The tourism and Hospitality industries may appear somewhat similar, but they have their subtle distinctions. Tourism mainly involves traveling and services to those who are away from home. The hospitality industry involves businesses and services that are concerned with leisure and enjoyment and mainly run on customer experience and satisfaction. Their customers may also be local inhabitants along with tourists. The hospitality industry can be majorly divided into  and   include hotels, resorts, hostels, motels, etc. The best of the hotels and resorts that were basking at their peeks, now have no option but to lay off their employees. Many hotels are down to zero occupancies and have led to an immense loss for the hotel establishments. The same is the case for resorts, hostels, motels, etc. that provide accommodations. Since there are no occupants, there is no money inflow, which is leading to the layoffs of employees as the owners are not able to provide paychecks anymore. Businesses in the accommodation sector that have just started, are finding it difficult to cope up with this situation. Various governments have extended small business bridge loans to cope up with this situation. The accommodations sector has no other way to cope with this situation but to wait for the situation to improve so that they can improve their business.  restrictions are imposed by various governments to avoid the spreading of Coronavirus. Travel agencies, car rentals, tour operators, flights, and airlines have been hit quite severely by COVID-19. Due to the fear of spreading Coronavirus, people have limited their public outings or have stopped stepping out altogether unless to shop for daily essentials. Coronavirus Impact on travel that ban lays out restrictions on who can travel from where to where. Many international and domestic flights have been suspended to tackle the Coronavirus crisis. Havoc is created across the aviation industry. The months from March to May are said to be the busiest times of the year for the tours and travel industry. But people are reluctant to travel in the fear of catching Coronavirus or getting stuck abroad if the governments announce restrictions, thereby overstaying their visas that can imply their future travels abroad. Airlines and tourism agencies have stopped marketing and advertising as it would be irresponsible and does not make sense during this crisis. To cope up with this situation, airlines like Virgin Atlantic and American Airlines have started deploying passenger flights to carry cargo, while various airlines have laid off. Commercial travel has dropped tremendously. Also, there is a recent drop in jet fuel prices. It is being estimated that many airlines are going to go bankrupt if this situation persists. Apart from airlines, the cruise industry and   this year. They are facing cancellations of bookings, and some new travel agencies are at a risk of closing down rendering all their employees either losing their jobs or going on unpaid leaves in this time of crisis. It is predicted that once the pandemic is over or the situation is under control, the travel and tour industry can take about 10 months to return to normalcy. However, this outbreak may affect the entire tourism industry’s future. Many   fall under the hospitality industry as they offer people  . Their customers not only include tourists but locals, passerby’s, etc. These mainly include restaurants, tea and coffee shops, bars and pubs, catering, etc. Catering is provided at places mainly where there is a social gathering, to deliver food and drinks services where it is not provided or not according to the organizer’s preference. Due to this pandemic, many countries are in lockdown, and even those that are not in lockdown are not allowed to hold public gatherings as a safety precaution. Due to the avoidance of public gatherings and events to maintain social distancing, catering services are halted for now. Restaurants, tea and coffee shops, pubs, and bars have all closed down not only for the   but also keeping in mind the safety of their employees and workers. However, a few restaurants that offer food delivery are still working, by taking all the necessary health and sanitation precautions to prevent the spreading of Coronavirus. The number of such restaurants seems to be declining with the increasing cases of COVID-19 as the customers are becoming more and more afraid and cautious about the situation. Though, quick-service food deliveries can cope better than the full-service restaurants during this crisis. Because of this unprecedented crisis, all these industries that are being affected are hoping for government support to make it through such tough times. Without some financial support or help from the government or other institutions, it will be difficult for various establishments to survive through this crisis. It is being indicated that the world will face the worst recession since the Great Depression during this pandemic with so many people losing their jobs, especially those working in the hospitality industry.

All the emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence and others are helping people live better and easier life. The service sector has also benefited a lot from digitization. It got further boost when Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in the year 2015, launched a campaign known as ‘Digital India.’ Among the various industries in the service sector, digitization has had a massive impact on the operation of the   It has helped in the development of this industry and enhances life for millions of people. The condition of India in terms of healthcare has been quite grim. Patients who need attention are neglected and are unable to avail proper treatment or diagnosis. However, with the coming up of digitization, there has been hoped for this industry also. According to Dr. Keshab Panda, CEO & MD, L&T Technology Services, This is a model of healthcare where doctors and hospitals are paid based on patient health outcomes. The coming up of digital tools in this segment of healthcare can be considered as the starting tool. Dr. Panda further says that the implementation of advanced digital technologies in patient-care domains like-  telehealth, wearables, and remote monitoring can help in enhancing accessibility, boost efficiency and augment the effectiveness of treatment and preventive care. The healthcare industry over the past few decades has changed drastically. With the coming of emerging technologies, new surgical procedures and medical devices have been made available. While talking about connectivity in healthcare, Dr. Panda said that with digitization taking over the industry, it is only a matter of time when with the help of the internet and smartphones, digital healthcare will be everywhere. The internet for once has helped doctors connect to their patients and also with one another. This has helped in enhancing the doctor-patient engagement by increasing their interaction time. Big data aggregates information about a business through formats such as social media, eCommerce, online transactions, and financial transactions, and identifies patterns and trends for future use. Although ransomware, data breaches, and other cybersecurity concerns are nothing new to the healthcare industry, the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic revealed just how vulnerable sensitive patient health information really is. The recent growth of digital health initiatives- like telehealth doctor visits — is a major contributor to the severe increase in breached patient records. As more healthcare functions continue to move online over the next year, it’s extremely important to ensure these processes are protected from outside threats. Medical practices are citing patient collections as their top revenue cycle management struggle as patients are becoming responsible for a larger portion of their medical bills. In order to help encourage patients to submit payments in a timely manner, providers must adhere to patient payment preferences. To meet patient expectations and improve the user experience, ensure billing statements are patient-friendly. You should offer paperless statements and a variety of payment options (e.g. credit card, etc.) via an online patient portal and utilize the latest payment technologies, such as mobile and text-to-pay. New features like text or email reminders help effectively communicate with patients and encourage them to pay their financial obligations. The medical insurance landscape has experienced some significant changes in recent years. As more patients are responsible for a larger portion of their healthcare bill, they naturally demand better services from their providers. Healthcare organizations will face tougher competition in attracting and retaining patients who demand an experience that matches the level of customer service they expect from other consumer brands. They demand a streamlined patient experience so they can “self-service” to resolve most questions, issues, or concerns (e.g., downloading an immunization record, booking an appointment, paying their bills, or checking their account/insurance status) whenever, wherever, and however is most convenient for them.

Take it or leave it, disruptive technology always creates new jobs much more than depleted jobs. You might notice certain jobs disappearing but those jobs are the jobs that transform humans to robots, to machines, and the technology is creating machines to replace them.  Technology creates the data analysis tools to manipulate and create custom scenarios using artificial intelligence (AI), Big Data and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to predict and drive consumer behavior. Data Analytics tools, such as Google Analytics , and others are available today for free, and, if used correctly, can help organizations save millions, maybe billions of dollars of sales and marketing. Before I go on, I think it’s best to level set on what constitutes  . In the context of this article , machines describe computers and computerized equipment, like robots, that have been programmed to learn, sometimes like humans. Occasionally we call this Artificial Intelligence (AI), other times we call this machine learning, and still other times we call this robotics. And yes, these are technically different things. These bots are more efficient than humans in some specific domains and are growing smarter with each passing day. They can do some really tough tasks which are considered difficult for any human being.  But, within the broad discussion related to the future of work, these are totally interrelated. Factory floors deploy robots that are increasingly driven by machine learning algorithms such that they can adjust to people working alongside them. A machine can work efficiently only it has abundant data and information about the work which is being imparted daily to them. But with every forward step & advancement in technology, a threat is proliferating, a threat of being replaced on our work front. Every passing day is sealing some jobs for humans all over the globe. Similarly, AI is being used to turn hand-drawn sketches (done by humans) into digital source code. Companies are clearly developing their AI and robotics expertise with the idea that through these technological innovations they’ll be able to Of course, it’s not just machines and creatives working together either. In another example, Amazon has employed more than 100,000 robots in its warehouses to efficiently move things around while it has increased its warehouse workforce by more than 80,000. Humans, in Amazon’s case, do the picking and packing of goods while robots move orders around the giant warehouses, essentially cutting “down on the walking required of workers, making Amazon pickers more efficient and less tired.” Plus, the robots “allow Amazon to pack shelves together like cars in rush-hour traffic because they no longer need aisle space for humans. The greater density of shelf space means more inventory under one roof, which means better selection for customers.” During the next few decades (or maybe sooner), the notion of work and whether it is handled by a human or a virtual being will hinge on predictability. As they are starting to do today, machines will manage the routine while humans take on the unpredictable – tasks that require creativity, problem-solving, and flexibility. In this context, robotics should be seen not only as a means to improve operations efficiency but also to improve the quality of life for workers. Although it is obvious that human factors involved in a work activity impact job automation, it is also true that highly repetitive tasks—and even mechanical ones—are ideal for robots. Besides greater efficiency and speed, automation leads to a lower risk of accidents, greater control and autonomy, and above all, fewer costs for organizations. Although artificial intelligence and machine learning make us believe that robots are endowed with superior intelligence, in fact they don’t yet have the ability to learn from experience and to respond to unknowns. So as things stand, however much processing speed and automatic learning a robot has, it doesn’t beat factors innate to the human brain. Humans are still a very essential part of the process. Think about delivering services to a client. Most customer challenges are routine, but humans play a very important role in addressing new issues, solving them the first time they appear, and then consolidating the process into the system. While machines and humans are placed in proximity,  robots can be expensive, but this doesn’t apply to all types, especially those based on Robotic Process Automation (RPA), where the development process incorporates algorithms that significantly reduce costs. Moreover, think of how domestic robots—be it a vacuum cleaner, a lawn mower or a pool cleaner—are increasingly part of our daily lives. This level of consumption that robotics has attained makes it affordable to automate tasks in modern homes to obtain greater control, security and comfort. The division between humans and machines has been clear – I’m here, the machine is there – but that boundary is getting fuzzier. Smart prosthetics fuse seamlessly with our bodies, making up for lost limbs or providing additional strength, stability, or resilience, as seen in exoskeletons donned by assembly line workers. We use our smartphones symbiotically, but what if they were integrated directly into our bodies? Think a smartphone in the form of a contact lens capable of transparently delivering augmented reality images straight to the brain. Think it sounds like science fiction? Think again. The first prototypes have already been built. Soon, brain-computer interfaces could become seamless as well, creating a new synergistic relationship between the cloud and us. At that point, the question of who knows what would be moot; you ask me a question and I know the answer. Sometimes that answer will be stored in my own neural circuitry, but most of the time it would come from the connection of my neurons to the web. Our brain’s decision process is influenced by the way it has been “educated” by the cultural context. These external factors are influencing our decision processes to the point that in certain situations, we can legitimately claim that influence has been so strong that our brains can’t be held accountable for the choices made. The point I’m trying to make is that we humans are in symbiosis with our cultural environment and the tools – both physical and conceptual – that we have been taught to use. My guess is that the transformation will be subtle. Practically speaking, robots growing to the point that they take over the world and then start creating smarter, better robots are impractical and should not even be a concern. None of this is expected in the near future, not by a long shot. If you’ve been to an ATM, waited for a PC to boot up after a catastrophic failure, or had a game crash on your X box just when you were about to reach a checkpoint, you understand that we are not in a world where machines do everything perfectly right. Before they can take over all of our jobs, they need to be able to do theirs’ flawlessly; until then, we can depend on humans to mess up our lives. This isn’t a win-or-lose situation. We’re going to wind up as a partner to our smarter machines, and that partnership will be fostered by our augmentation through technology. Machines will play an essential role in this augmentation and, as with any successful technology, they will fall below our level of perception. In the end, the revolution will be silent and invisible.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/how-ai-will-change-the-world-blackcoffer/", "title": "How AI will change the World? | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "The way work is being done now is destined to undergo massive transformational changes which will impact humans and their ways of working dramatically. With the development of the new machine programs, A.I. is all set to take over the humans in their workplace as no other did. Now we are not only in competition with other beings but with robots too. And robots will overcome us in our fields of work. At present we are being surrounded by A.I. from dusk till dawn, from facial recognition present in our mobile application to dating websites/applications which uses decision making as their algorithms and learn from the past data as well. It is believed that A.I. has grown over 270% over the last years. First, let us know what A.I. is and all the fuss going on about it? A.I. as defined by the internet is simply ‘simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions’. This translates to, it can work as a human being just at fast speed and with 100% accuracy. In my definition I would define A.I. as the god form of human beings. Now the question that arises is, what does A.I. entails for the future? A.I. is fancy enough to continue existing in our minds all the time, but it does come with certain limitations and threats which is a cause for a peaceful sleep for most of the workers. With its introduction to different areas of the workplace, it is clear that half of the human jobs would be taken up by A.I. and then there would arise a need for more jobs for humans in new upcoming AI-based ventures in different industries. Thereby giving us our fair share back to us. In a survey, it was found that some believed that AI will be devastating for humans and while some professionals and tech-savvy people believed that inculcating AI technology into business and our daily lives would be a remarkable step as it will lead to the flourishment of business in the future and give them a competitive edge over their rivals. People believed that when these advanced technologies would come together to work with humans, they will produce a smarter strategic decision with productive collaborative practices. More modern technology prevailing in the organization will lead to stress reduction and produce more satisfying results thereby making the organization more efficient. The Organizations who are in use of the AI technology responds by saying that their managers are more comfortable using A.I. and are accustomed to it and the organizations are now looking forward to having integration of higher-end technology systems, as it is believed that new technology will result in more productivity thereby making more profits in the long run. Many jobs today require AI and humans working in collaboration, which creates a positive signal that in the future to humans would be working closely with the technology. Beyond just training and developing these machines, humans would be working in close vicinity with them and making decisions on how to act on the result that is given by the machine. It can be said that both the AI advanced technology and human can’t remain in the workforce without each other, as the technology will produce accurate and top-notch results but it requires someone to make delivery. e.g., in a firm, an AI-based system produces results based on historical data but there is a need for someone to analyze and communicate and present this data to the respective stakeholders whether inside or outside of the organization. Various uses of artificial intelligence technology in day-to-day functions in regards to interactions with humans are: Artificial intelligence as we know works on algorithms, neural networks, and deep learning which all are analytical tools that help AI in taking analytical decisions based on the data provided. Whereas, humans on the other hand take higher-level decisions based on ‘Intuition’ sometimes, which refers to the gut feeling that generates in humans concerning any situation or challenge. AI alone can’t work to handle critical situations on its own as it needs humans for it to reciprocate them and share the information with stakeholders, and humans alone can’t anticipate much on the accurate and fast-paced analytical solutions to the problems persisting in place of the situation. The strength of humans and AI working in synergy can be surprisingly beneficial and advantageous to organizations. It is believed that machines in the future would be eating up our traditional jobs. But the reality seems to be turning otherwise. The future trend shows that in future the AI-powered technology would take up jobs that were being done by humans but in return would produce more jobs that would require human interference with them. As and when the newer technology is approaching more and more countries are now proceeding towards GIG Economies, and so in the future, we can witness an increase in freelance jobs and the permanent labor market norms could reduce drastically. Some of the jobs today will be replaced by AI which is in the transportation or retail commerce sector that can be 100% automated in the future years. There is an ‘Amazon Go’ store that uses this technology which goes by the name ‘Just walk out technology’ wherein there is no need for any human-induced workforce and all the operations are carried out by AI-powered technologies, which is indeed a breakthrough technology in today’s world. Rather than eating up our jobs AI in return will be creating more jobs in the future by creating massive innovations thereby fueling up many new industries and thereby giving us our fair share of jobs back. There will be a lot of demand placed on the upcoming young workforce which is also categorized as ‘Gen Z’. They are expected to know more about technology and would be high in demand.  These young generations are required to learn new skills which are needed to survive in the dynamic changing environment, and as most of the activities that are carried out by workers will be automated, there will be demand for people working in the back office and maintaining and developing the technology to its best versions.   AI powered technology has its limitations which makes it a rigid system to hold on to and also which makes it a costly affair at the initial stage.   It was predicted that the cost of electricity to power a supercharged AI model was around $4.6 million. So, this super-powered AI can be purchased only by big fortune firms and thereby creating more value to their net worth. One of the major limitations of AI is that it can contain biased data as the scientists who put in the data can create biasedness and so the resultant output of the same would have a biased report. These machines as do not have neuroscience-based technology in them yet which enables them to carry human emotions to understand complex situations and a creative way out of that, they tend to have a lack of out of box thinking which in the case is rigid in themselves as they are programmed to work on a single task and they cannot perform more than a single task at the same time. It is also believed that there exists no creativity among the computer, no matter it is fast-paced, but they are not intelligent. Businesses and organizations need to understand and anticipate the opportunities that the future holds for them and they need to start training their employees based on today’s dynamic changing technology. While it’s still unclear what does the future holds for us, but the anticipation of it could benefit us in several ways. As we are unclear about what the future looks like, we need to think in probable terms how it could turn out to be and then employ specific training programs for the employees of the organization. The training the employees are needed to be done on a continuous and lifetime basis which means that education won’t be only limited to PG degrees but will be now a lifetime process of learning. As the Covid-19 changed the scenario of the work patterns around the world, we now need to think strategically about the working dynamics of the future and how does it look like compared to the pre-covid and post-covid scenario. Employees will be playing a major role in transforming the organizations and work practices in the upcoming future, so organizations need to select and recruit the best candidates among the pool and then provide them with best practices of the new machines and make proficient in their area of work. Policies need to be developed to hire the best people and then retaining the talent in the organization. There needs to be a continuous scanning of the environment by the organizations to comprehend any new trends and assess them, not all trends will be beneficial for organizations, they must be aware of the prospects and plan for the future systematically and consistently. There lies a possibility in future certain years from now, we could have machines who will have general human intelligence who would be able to answer deep meaningful questions asking ‘Why are the curtains blue?’, would be able to clean cars, play politics and tell jokes to us, and by using deep and machine learning programs their level of intelligence would be beyond mathematical calculations to us. That’s how good machines will be in the future, but to make ourselves competitive with machines, we would need to train ourselves for the impending ambiguous future ahead of us. Humans and machines need to work in synergy to get beneficial and satisfying results for both parties. Machines are indeed going take away many of our jobs, but let me make you sleep peacefully tonight, the machines aren’t arriving until we’re retired.   We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

This is made possible by the leveraging of various analytics tools and practices by the healthcare providers for improving their operational efficiency. The volume of data available is expected to be increasing at an exponential rate in the years ahead. Current cumbersome techniques of evaluation will soon have to pave the way for advanced analytics. These techniques, which have the ability to process, act on, manage and distribute data from a variety of sources, will become the backbone of the healthcare sector. With this evaluation, the vast health data will be better understood and more effective, real-time, specific decisions can be taken. Before discussing the future, it is important to reflect upon the current scenario. After the introduction of Electronic Health Records (EHR), the amount of data collected have gone up significantly, creating metadata that can be used for querying. Healthcare organizations have resorted to analytical tools to improve the efficiency of patient examination. With a wide range of information about the patient’s history, genetics and demographics, more customized quality care could be provided. More and more venture capitalists have started investing in healthcare analytics. However, healthcare organizations are a long way from making effective use of such information. A proper understanding of the vast applications of such a resource is still scarce. Differentiating between quality data and noise has been becoming more and more difficult. The high cost of analytic solutions and lack of skilled professionals have been a pain point in many organizations. The data in many situations come from places with questionable data governance standards. Obtaining data that meets the standards required for accurate use is one of the major ongoing battles in organizations. Lack of understanding of the usage of EHR (Electronic Healthcare Records) and the importance of capturing quality data further adds to the lack of data quality. :  Improvements in data capture by prioritizing valuable data types and educating clinicians about how to ensure that data is useful for downstream analytics are some of the ways forward. Presence of inaccurate unwanted data (noise) can derail the effectiveness of the analytics system. The data, which comes from disparate data sources in multiple formats, unless acted upon properly will lead to inconsistency. Though Data cleaning, the process of ensuring the datasets are consistent, accurate and relevant, are being done, most organizations still use inefficient manual methods. : IT vendors are now coming up with applications which use machine learning that use rules to filter and segregate data, which will make the process effective and affordable With the latest developments in technology, the amount of data being generated and captured is increasing at an alarming rate. Even though most enterprises currently prefer on-premise data storage which has the advantage of having better control over security and access, it has become difficult to modify, scale and adapt to situations. : Many organizations are slowly shifting to cloud storage and various hybrid approaches to store their data. This provides a highly scalable, cost-effective solution which provides ease of access. With the recent episodes of high profile hackings, security breaches, ransomware, etc security has become a huge concern in this technological era. From a small action like leaving the laptop unsecured to highly sophisticated hacking, data is not safe in spite of many initiatives being taken. : Employees are being educated in transmission security, authentication protocols, and controls over access, integrity, and auditing. Procedures such as using the latest anti-virus software, setting up firewalls, encrypting sensitive data, and using multi-factor authentication are some of the ways to prevent security attacks. As we move forward in 2018, organizations will have to analyze much more complex and high-volume data. With the development of customized, highly efficient data analytics practices, organizations can make sense of the data and use it for providing efficient personalized care. Data integrity is bound to become the most important factor as the effectiveness of data analysis methods are dependent on the incorporation of error-free, relevant data from quality sources.   \n \n We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

Our end-to-end AI enabled platforms speed time to delivery, save costs, reduce risk, and deliver optimized results to give you an immediate competitive advantage and bolster your bottom line. AI is “an area of computer science that deals with giving machines the ability to seem like they have human intelligence”. Human intelligence encompasses a wide spectrum of cognitive tasks, which can range from simple rule-based logic to pattern recognition, to more complex communication-based “human work”.  A new regulatory framework specifically tailored to promote\nthe development of safe and effective medical devices that use advanced\nartificial intelligence algorithms. These types of algorithms are already being used to aid in\nscreening for diseases and to provide treatment recommendations. Last year, the\nFDA authorized an artificial intelligence-based device for detecting\ndiabetic retinopathy, an eye disease that can cause vision loss. We’re taking the first step toward developing a novel and tailored the approach to help developers bring artificial intelligence devices to market by releasing a discussion paper. Other steps in the future will include issuing draft guidance that will be informed by the input we receive. Our approach will focus on the continually-evolving nature of these promising technologies. With a\nbasic algorithm, a computer has to be “spoon-fed” data, and the output will be\nproportional to the effort people put in. However, with a cleverer algorithm\nthat enables computers to “learn” as more data is entered (or as it goes\nthrough numerous trial-and-errors), one gets improved functionality (the\nprogram gets smarter with more data). Algorithms are the core of artificial\nintelligence work. In the following three of the main concepts are discussed;\nartificial neural networks, deep learning, and unsupervised learning. : algorithms for artificial intelligence have shown significant development in the past few years based on the new environment with better-than-ever processors and an abundance of data to test on. It started with the realization of “artificial neural networks”. True to their name, artificial neural networks are modeled after a human’s biological neural network, comprising of neurons connected together in an intricate net. Biological neural networks enable a higher level of abstraction in information processing compared to a traditional computer. For example, we can see a few images of a cat and recognize a cat next time we see a similar image. A similar process happens in artificial neural networks when presented with thousands of cat images. The concept of artificial neural networks has existed for several decades already, but only recently has this been enabled for practical application because of enhanced processing power and sufficient data sets available. : to manage the extremely complicated network of\ndifferent computations, developers came up with the concept of dividing this\nnetwork into different layers and guide the flow of information through\nmultiple layers. For example, in determining if a picture includes a cat, there\nwould be different layers of questioning that the artificial brain has to go\nthrough before reaching that conclusion. The sequence of questions for\nidentifying a cat could go “Does it have four legs?” → “Is it covered in fur?”\n→ “Does it have long whiskers?” and so on. However, this process is never\nperfect from the beginning, as the logic may not be accurate all the time.\nGoing back to the example, this algorithm may say that certain types of dogs\nare cats, and hairless cats would not be recognized as an image of a cat. “Deep\nlearning” is the technique developed to overcome this type of limitation. In\nthe AI world, the term ‘learning’ is basically a feedback process where the\nnetwork gets feedback on the result it has produced, and has a self-correcting\nfeature if the result is wrong. This is achieved by reassigning weights on the\nlayers (individual questions asked) so that it gets a statistically optimized\nalgorithm that will enhance the probability of getting the right answer  the network must be engineered so it is generalizable and applicable to new examples, and humans need to interfere by labeling the input data and determining whether the output result is right or wrong. For instance, when teaching a network to recognize a cat, the programmer will direct the network to look at certain attributes that will distinguish a cat image from other images. When the network returns a result, the programmer will supervise the training by telling the network if it was right or wrong. The network would learn right from wrong through adjusting the weights given to each attribute to minimize the possibility of getting the answer wrong. Because of this level of supervision, some argue that the current realization of artificial intelligence is not ‘real’ AI. These people argue that this technology is not really a machine that can think on its own like a human, but rather just advanced computation.  a new approach that is trying to overcome these shortcomings and get one step closer to ‘real’ AI, is called unsupervised learning. While supervised learning requires a dataset containing the correct answers (labels), unsupervised learning does not require the correct answers ahead of time. It’s like throwing an algorithm out in the wild and letting it figure out the correct answers for itself. A good comparison would be networks that recognize cat images (supervised learning, like the example above) versus networks that learn to play video-games (unsupervised learning). When teaching a network to ace a video game like Breakout through an unsupervised method, the programmer does not tell the algorithm to avoid dropping the ball, or that the goal is to eliminate all the bricks on the screen. Instead, the algorithm is simply directed to maximize the score. This method has the potential of finding new unconventional solutions that “think outside the box” as human bias is not used to guide the algorithm. This method is expected to be very useful once matured since most data is not structured or labeled. It is expected to open AI to new possibilities. Unsupervised learning could also be used to develop a general AI tool that solves complex “human” problems (also called “real AI”), instead of humans having to tediously assign specific tasks to an algorithm. After years of research and development by our team of expert, we are proud to present our suite of proprietary platforms focused on detection and analysis, prediction & forecasting, and yield optimization.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/traceability-of-information-master-your-data-capital/", "title": "Traceability of information – Master your data capital | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "The   of data access and usage in the enterprise is underway. Establishing data governance and organization-wide information management becomes a must. Metadata management allows the  , from data sourcing to data consumption. This traceability is required for personal data by regulations such as GDPR. Traceability means transparency of flows of goods and data – a basic requirement for a modern supply chain. Consumers, authorities and various quality assurance and product standards demand transparent information on raw materials and primary packaging. Brand owners need to be able to fully answer questions quickly, at the batch level, on the source of raw materials, production methods, and staging points. With a good traceability information system, a brand owner can guarantee protection for consumers and itself. It can quickly contain any problems and provide adequate information, which builds confidence among consumers and the authorities. We choose MUML as the underlying software design method due to its existing support for real-time, and due to our preliminary work on the approach (cf. Sect. 4). Furthermore, we rely on consensus for the specification of requirements due to its tight integration with MUML. More precisely, we provide the following partial solutions to the traceability problem for information flow requirements: at the level of consensus system models. To address challenge C1, we provide systems engineers with a specification technique for information flow requirements, allowing them to mark a flow between elements of a system, or its environment, as illegitimate. The specification needs to take place in a form that enables a later comparison against the actual information flow detected through verification. Thus, by distinguishing illegitimate from legitimate flow, it is possible to judge whether the information flow requirements are violated.  flow properties from the specified requirements in an automatic fashion. As a contribution to challenge C3, the derived properties relate the initial requirements to a MUML software design model and allow to verify the model’s compliance. In order to produce meaningful verification results, the derived properties need to preserve the semantics of the initial requirements and, therefore, the derivation needs to interrelate the consensus system model and the MUML software design model. It is beneficial to infer the relation between these models automatically from the traces of a model transformation.  on the basis of software design models. In order to overcome challenge i.e., to decide whether a given MUML model fulfills the derived information flow properties, rigorous verification of the non-interference needs to be carried out. To this end, we enrich the theoretical basis of real-time non-interference by a ready-to-use verification technique. To cope with the infinite, real-valued state space, we explicitly consider the applicability of existing verification techniques from the area of real-time model checking.  to trace them back to the initial requirements as a further contribution to challenge C3. Depending on the complexity of the interrelations between MUML software design and Conses system model, the verification results obtained so far are of little significance, as they do not allow the engineers to draw immediate conclusions about the initial information flow requirements. Therefore, in order to give significance to the results, we automatically relate them back to the requirements specified initially. Every specified requirement needs to be marked as met (if the non-occurrence of information flow has been proved by the verification), or as a violation (if the verification detected the occurrence of an illegitimate flow). Previous studies have shown that software traceability, the ability to link together related artifacts from different sources within a project (e.g., source code, use cases, documentation, etc.), improves project outcomes by assisting developers and other stakeholders with common tasks such as impact analysis, concept location, etc. Establishing traceability links in a software system is an important and costly task, but only half the struggle. As the project undergoes maintenance and evolution, new artifacts are added and existing ones are changed, resulting in outdated traceability information. Therefore, specific steps need to be taken to make sure that traceability links are maintained in tandem with the rest of the project. In this article, we address this problem and propose a novel approach called TRAIL for maintaining traceability information in a system. Traceability in an open supply chain which help company in achieving: In addition, labor hours can be reallocated to focus on revenue-generating activities versus the double reporting that occurs when data is collected manually and then later transferred into a computer system. For that purpose, a traceability system identifies objects by using a representation format such as serial numbers or lot numbers, as well as the transfer medium such as labels and RF tags. When all people related to the supply chain, including consumers, can recognize the status of the product and objects and information has been linked, tracing forward/back can be done easily. This ensures the quality and safety of the product. We currently work towards reducing the verification problem to a refinement check for real-time systems. After preparing the verification backend, we plan to address the requirements specification at the level of model-based systems engineering, and the derivation of verifiable properties within the next year. Finally, we intend to carry out the final integration of systems engineering and software design in order to establish the desired traceability solution. Our evaluation strategy enables us to carry out a stepwise, incremental validation of our contributions.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/problems-faced-by-students-in-online-classes-during-covid-19/", "title": "Problems faced by students in online classes during COVID-19 | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "The Covid-19 pandemic and the prolonged lockdown induced by it has made working as well as studying from home the new normal. Though the concept of online learning existed even during the pre-pandemic era, the phenomenon has certainly reached an altogether different level and intensity in these trying times. All stakeholders, including students, teachers, and institutions are forced to overcome challenges that have come with this sudden and often hastily executed online learning programs. In a lot of cases, the key driver for the adoption of a technology platform was whether or not it was free. This led to a lot of products being adopted which made the adoption curve significantly steeper. There was a lot of predatory behavior by some of the large technology players to get a foothold in the education sector. This led to new verbs like “zoom bombing” being added to the English lexicon. One of the major stumbling blocks about online learning is the lack of strong and stable internet connections, as the ones conventionally used at homes have either low bandwidth or have exhausted their limits. Just the process of logging in for a class itself becomes a cumbersome process for students and teachers alike. Even as upgrading the broadband connection is a prima facie solution, but it certainly isn’t a fool-proof one. What’s needed for the purpose is a tool that can make logging in a one-time process. There’s a need for an app wherein both teachers and students can simply select their class/subject and get going. Assessing a student in the right manner is an integral component of the education system. Under normal circumstances, students are made to take a test or appear in an examination on school premises, unfortunately, that’s not a possibility now. In online learning, assessing students through a Multiple-Choice Question (MCQ) mechanism is still feasible as a stopgap but real learning is measured by conducting a subjective assessment — this is one of the biggest challenges for traditional EdTech solutions that are predominantly MCQ based. So, what’s needed here is a tool that provides a comprehensive assessment system wherein the requirements of both the teachers as well as the students are met. Accept it or not, there are quite a few students who try to leverage the easy way to success. It has become easier for them to cheat while using online learning systems. While we agree that this is primarily about being self-disciplined, educational institutions should look at minimizing the possibility of students subverting the sanctity of assessments that are used to improve the learning of the class and the student too. To check this menace, we have developed a secure mechanism on our platform wherein the teacher is immediately informed when a student leaves the examination screen to access a browser, etc. We also shuffle the questions so children cannot use communication mediums to get an unfair advantage. No matter what you do on the Internet, concern about data privacy and security is always associated. Usually, teachers conduct online classes through free platforms such as ZOOM and Google Classroom. But they are not the safest or the most secure tools for learning. The need is to make use of new-age EdTech platforms that ensure a safe online environment. Last but possibly the most significant challenges associated with online learning is monotony and boredom induced by increased exposure to the screen as well as the modus operandi of sitting at one restricted spot for prolonged hours. The onus of breaking this boredom or fatigue lies with the teachers and the educational institution. There is a need for a consistent endeavor to make the session as interactive as feasible. Taking this aspect of online learning into consideration, we have developed a mechanism in our EdTech platform through which students can be engaged in polls and other similar activities. There is also a provision of a whiteboard-style tool wherein teachers and students can draw or write anything, eventually making learning more interactive. The concept of traditional education has changed radically within the last couple of years. Being physically present in a classroom isn’t the only learning option anymore — not with the rise of the internet and new technologies, at least. Nowadays, you have access to a quality education whenever and wherever you want, as long as you can get online. We are now entering a new era — the revolution of online education. There’s no need to discount the skepticism surrounding education through the internet. It’s hard to understand the notion of leaving behind the conventional classroom, especially if it’s to face this vast space called The Internet. Keep on reading to learn five more reasons why you should get involved in online education: Online education enables the teacher and the student to set their own learning pace, and there’s the added flexibility of setting a schedule that fits everyone’s agenda. As a result, using an online educational platform allows for a better balance of work and studies, so there’s no need to give anything up. Studying online teaches you vital time management skills, which makes finding a good work-study balance easier. Having a common agenda between the student and teacher can also prompt both parties to accept new responsibilities and have more autonomy. In a space as vast as the internet, there are infinite skills and subjects to teach and learn. A growing number of universities and higher education schools are offering online versions of their programs for various levels and disciplines. From music composition to quantum physics, there are options for every type of student. Studying your program online is also a great option for getting an official certificate, diploma, or degree without physically setting foot on a university campus. Online education enables you to study or teach from anywhere in the world. This means there’s no need to commute from one place to another or follow a rigid schedule. On top of that, not only do you save time, but you also save money, which can be spent on other priorities. The virtual classroom is also available anywhere there’s an internet connection, and a good way to take advantage of this is to travel. For example, if you’re studying abroad and want to get a job, online education is a great choice. There’s no reason to give up on working or studying while exploring new and exotic places. As mentioned before how flexibility can help you to set your own study pace. But online education is also flexible for each student’s requirements and level of ability. Online classes tend to be smaller than conventional class sizes. Most of the time, online learning platforms only allow one student at a time, and in almost all cases, this allows for greater interaction and more feedback between you and your tutor. There’s often access to very diverse material such as videos, photos, and eBooks online as well, and tutors can also integrate other formats like forums or discussions to improve their lessons. Unlike in-person education methods, online education tends to be more affordable. There’s also often a wide range of payment options that let you pay in installments or per class. This allows for better budget management. Many of you may also be subject to discounts or scholarships, so the price is rarely high. You can also save money from the commute and class materials, which are often available for free. In other words, the monetary investment is less, but the results can be better than other options. These are only a few reasons to choose online education, and why 90 percent of students today think that online learning is the same or better than the traditional classroom experience. Every student must assess their unique situation and decide according to their needs and goals, and while this alternative to traditional education is not for everyone, it’s still a convenient option with virtually endless options for international students all over the world. We have looked at both the positives as well as negatives of online education and when you compare them it can be observed and that’s what I feel, online education in today’s hour is a problematic norm which has taken over the world, whereby the students aren’t receiving the best learning due to the restrictions which are revolving around online teaching and the methods which are adopted aren’t much use with the students’ engagement, causing a lot of distress for them to be able to adapt what’s thrown at them quickly and easily. This topic can be written in unlimited pages, however considering the limitation of the words and also things changing each day about the education patterns, you can never figure out what’s good and what’s not. Hence, I would like to end my article here by saying: “Keep Learning, Method Could Be Any”.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/marketing-analytics-needs/", "title": "Marketing Analytics – Why do we care about it? | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "To completely understand about marketing analytics and why do we care about it, we must first clear our basics like: Marketing analytics is a study of process and technology that enable marketers to analyze data and metrics to determine the dynamics of a special market within a special industry and also help in understanding the impact and measure performance based on marketing activities. It uses the important measure to maximize ROI and identify the areas of improvement, overall marketing effectiveness. As businesses expand into a new market, new technologies were adopted to support them. Diverse technologies were implemented across several platforms in order for companies to advertise., market and clear brand awareness. As a marketer, along with your long task list, you need to be conversant with every new marketing medium that is introduced. But how do you know which of your efforts are making a difference? Is the new platform or new technology that you just signed-up for even bringing in any results? Companies need to analyze data from a combination of channels where marketing activity was carried out. This permits them to be sure about campaign performance. But initially, marketers were only checking for data and deciding about campaign success. You can’t rely on guesswork or gut feeling to be successful in this era of marketing. You need to back up the feasibility of every activity with facts and figures. It helps you understand which marketing activities are bringing in revenue. Marketing Analytics eliminated this roadblock by facilitating data scrutiny across all channels. Stakeholders now had enhanced clarity about product performance. Marketing Analytics was revolutionary in changing the Marketing dynamic. Before the marketing analytics, the company should design a Bright strategy based on the company objectives. Several tools are available in the digital marketplace that allows companies to construct tailor-made campaigns which revolve around their product and help them find their company objectives in the market. These tools center around search engine audience sentiment about popular keywords, trends, popular hashtags among many others. By building a campaign that includes these words marketers can place their bets for a campaign victory. The strategy is the key and depending on brand perception, platforms that resonate the product should be engaged in the campaign. Once the campaign is launched, back-end analytic tools come into the picture. These tools will allow marketers to check for various aspects that encapsulate the digital marketing spectrum like conversions, incoming leads, website traffic, etc. Vast amounts of data get generated during the campaigning process which can be converted into meaningful insights. Marketers need to ensure that they have covered and collated data elements getting generated from all the sources which were involved in a marketing campaign. The data generated would be unstructured. A model consists of columns in a spreadsheet and calculation used to give you results or metrics. This is the perfect time to understand what data you have to work with and to possibly bring in an experienced analyst to assist with questions. You may have more to work with than you initially thought, so it’s best to lay it all out. This data can later be structured by the use of several tools to get transparency about how customers are shopping today. With an increasing number of people buying products on their mobile phones, entrepreneurs are trying to make shopping as rapid as possible for this group of buyers. Omnichannel e-commerce platforms are also the rage. Just like data analysis can give specific insights, the overall scope of Marketing Analytics can be put in a nutshell by these functions. Marketing Analytics tools provide precise information about campaign performance along with determining areas of improvement if any and predicting how they would perform in the future.  Tools help to understand if the competitor campaign is doing better and why it is doing better. It helps to understand what competitors are doing right and if they are using certain channels that might garner more campaign success.  Finally, it allows you, the campaign originator to reflect as an organization if the marketing resource allocation is appropriate or not. It also helps in understanding the next steps that need to be taken allowing to reshuffle priorities. Lastly, it helps to understand if money and time are being immersed in the right marketing mediums. To get the most benefit from marketing analytics, you need an analytic assortment that is balanced – that is, one that combines techniques for:  By using marketing analytics to report on the past, you can answer such questions as Which campaign elements generated the most revenue last quarter? How did an email campaign A perform against direct mail campaign B? How many leads did we generate from blog post C versus social media campaign D?  Marketing analytics enables you to determine how your marketing initiatives are performing right now by answering questions like: How are our customers engaging with us? Which channels do our most profitable customers prefer? Who is talking about our brand on social media sites, and what are they saying?  Marketing analytics can also deliver data-driven predictions that you can use to influence the future by answering such questions as: How can we turn short-term wins into loyalty and ongoing engagement? How will adding 10 more sales people in under-performing regions affect revenue? Which cities should we target next using our current portfolio? Marketing organizations have access to a lot of different analytic capabilities in support of various marketing goals, but if you’re like most, you probably don’t have all your bases covered. Assessing your current analytic capabilities is a good next step. After all, it’s important to know where you stand along the analytic spectrum, so you can identify where the gaps are and start developing a strategy for filling them in. For example, a marketing organization may already be collecting data from online and POS transactions, but what about all the unstructured information from social media sources or call-center logs? Such sources are a gold mine of information, and the technology for converting unstructured data into actual insights that marketers can use exists today. As such, a marketing organization may choose to plan and budget for adding analytic capabilities that can fill that particular gap. Of course, if you’re not quite sure where to start, well, that’s easy. Start where your needs are greatest, and fill in the gaps over time as new needs arise. There is absolutely no real value in all the information marketing analytics can give you –  . In a constant process of testing and learning, marketing analytics enables you to improve your overall marketing program performance by, for example: Identifying channel deficiencies. Adjusting strategies and tactics as needed. Optimizing processes. Gaining customer insight. Without the ability to test and evaluate the success of your marketing programs, you would have no idea what was working and what wasn’t, when or if things needed to change, or how. By the same token, if you use marketing analytics to evaluate success, but you do nothing with that insight, then what is the point? Applied holistically, marketing analytics allows for better, more successful marketing by enabling you to close the loop as it relates to your marketing efforts and investments. For example, marketing analytics can lead to better supply and demand planning, price optimization, as well as robust lead nurturing and management, all of which leads to more revenue and greater profitability. By more effectively managing leads and being able to tie those leads to sales – which is known as closed-loop marketing analytics – you can see which specific marketing initiatives are contributing to your bottom line. In the realm of marketing, primary research has traditionally focused on quantitative or qualitative methodologies to provide customer insights. With advances in technology, especially data mining, marketing analytics has become an invaluable tool and should be viewed as an equal component of the marketing research toolkit. Analytics requires marketers to use data to understand customers at every touch point throughout their lifecycle with the business. To do this the analyst must mine, analyze, interpret, and present the information so that it is converted into actionable intelligence. In this process, the customer’s information DNA is tracked, segmented, modeled and then acted upon. As these concepts and tools become standard operating procedures, marketing departments must internalize analytics into their overall curriculum in order to provide Company with a compelling competitive advantage.

This story could have been a tale in the present but it is not. So, with such huge volumes of data being generated at every step in the healthcare value chain and enough advances in technology to explore varied data, what is stopping us from using technology and being data-driven in healthcare today? For any industry to be data-driven the main element of decision-making is – you guessed it right “Data” and this is exactly where the problem lies. For a data-driven approach to making complex decisions, it is imperative to   that can be utilized to derive useful insights and predict future outcomes with high accuracy. Thus if healthcare needs to fully exploit data and analytics it needs to develop three strong capabilities – integration of data from multiple sources, capability to build and develop advanced analytical models with lower error margins and the ability to transform the organization into a breeding ground for deep insights and predictive prognosis with the right mindset inclined to adopting transformation so that the analytical models drive results. : Finding the right data is the major challenge in any analytics project and more so in healthcare, the major reason being low adoption rates of digital data capturing methods and high data fragmentation.    means that healthcare providers still rely on manual modes of data entry like notes or oral recommendations to convey a patient’s medical information. Despite being one of the most technologically advanced countries the Electronic Health Records (EHR) adoption rate is only 67% as of the end of May 2017. This is dismal state and analytics based on such limited information is not a good representation of the actual population. In developing countries, the percentages are more disappointing with low digitized data available and lesser interoperability.   With the growth in technologies like remote monitoring, wearables, social media analytics, etc.  Clinical data like EHR and EMR, monthly/ yearly credit card transactions used to make medical payments, medical claim settlements, genetic databases, public records, are major sources of data for analytics. This makes the   and difficult to work on due to  . Fragmented database seldom leads to standardized good quality data. Also, every organization has a different goal to achieve with the data it collects and hence the nature of data captured by each is different.  No UPI or any unique identifier for the patient makes it   from different sources. Countries like Australia, Canada, France, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and the U.K which have advanced on their EHR capabilities to achieve almost a 100% adoption rate with high interoperability have done so by employing UPIs. The only way to overcome these challenges is to layout stronger data governance laws, ensure government regulations that do not allow providers to create barriers to exit for the patients and incentivize healthcare providers to adopt digital transformation strategies. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a step in the right direction to protect Patient Health Information (PHI) and mandates providers to set up a compliant infrastructure for threats against security. However, we still have a long way to go before the fears of both the health care providers and patients with electronic modes of capturing data are assuaged and we have better capabilities for capturing relevant data giving the much-needed impetus to analytics in healthcare.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/sales-forecasting-in-retail/", "title": "Statistical Methods for Sales Forecasting in Retail Industry | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "Inventory planning is a fundamental part of retail operations. Proper retail inventory management, which helps to balance supply and demand, relies heavily on an accurate forecast of future demand. In fact, sales forecasting refers to predicting future demand (or sales), assuming that the factors which affected demand in the past and are affecting the present will still have an influence in the future. It is an important task but is very difficult to accomplish. In the retailing industry, which is defined as the retailing business of products including apparel, shoes, and fashion beauty products, forecasting itself can be treated like a “service” which represents the set of analytical tools that facilitate the companies to make the best decisions for predicting the future. Undoubtedly, a good forecasting service system can help to avoid understocking or over-stocking in retail inventory planning, which further relates to other critical operations of the whole supply chain such as due date management, production planning, pricing, and achieving high customer service level. In order to achieve economics sustainability under a highly competitive environment, a company should adopt a consumer-demand driven “pull” operational strategy which means forecasting becomes a critically important task. Compared to other retailing service industries, it is well argued that sales forecasting is a very difficult task in fashion retailing because fashion product’s demand is highly volatile with the ever-changing taste of the consumers and the fashion product’s life cycle is very short. In addition, the sales of fashion products are strongly affected “stochastically” by seasonal factors, fashion trend factors, and many tricky variables (e.g., weather, marketing strategy, political climate, item features, and macroeconomic trend). These, together with the fact that fashion retailers are carrying a large number of stock-keeping units (SKUs) with limited historical sales data, all make sales forecasting challenging and call for more sophisticated and versatile analytical tools. On the other hand, it is known that the fashion apparel supply chain is a relatively long one which includes upstream cotton plants, fiber manufacturers, apparel factories, distributors, wholesalers, and retailers. As a consequence, the notorious bullwhip effect will have a particularly strong influence on the fashion supply chain. Since forecasting is a critical factor relating to the presence and significance of the bullwhip effect, improving forecasting can help reduce the bullwhip effect which directly enhances the efficiency of the fashion supply chain. Traditionally, fashion sales forecasting is accomplished by statistical methods. In fact, a lot of statistical methods have been used for sales forecasting, which includes linear regression, moving average, weighted average, exponential smoothing (used when a trend is present but not linear), exponential smoothing with the trend, double exponential smoothing, Bayesian analysis, and so forth. Statistical time series analysis tools such as ARIMA and SARIMA are widely employed in sales forecasting. Since these methods have a closed form expression for forecasting, it is simple and easy to implement and the results can be computed very quickly. The pure statistical models have a deficiency in conducting fashion retail forecasting, in order to improve forecasting accuracy. AI methods emerge with the advance of computer technology. In fact, AI models can efficiently derive “arbitrarily nonlinear” approximation functions directly from the data. Popular methods such as artificial neural network (ANN) models and fuzzy logic models are commonly employed in the literature and they are the first kind of models being employed for fashion retail sales forecasting. To be specific, ANN models have been developed and they provide satisfactory results in different domains. Hybrid forecasting methods are usually developed based on the fact that they can utilize the strengths of different models together to form a new forecasting method. As such, many of them are considered to be more efficient than pure statistical models and pure AI models. It is not surprising that in recent years, a number of research works examine hybrid forecasting methods. Hybrid methods employed in the fashion forecasting literature often combine different schemes such as fuzzy model, ANN, and ELM with other techniques such as statistical models, the grey model (GM), and so forth. Following are more adapted hybrid methods: Sales forecasting is a real-world problem in fashion retailing. From the perspective on applications and implementation, various issues are identified.   \n \n We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

Marketing defined by many as   or as the  Nowadays along customers/buyers don’t only stop at satisfaction they expect for more that is: So to fulfill all these expectations of the buyer’s marketers need to start moving from a one-size-fits-most to the perfect way of “Promoting and Selling the Perfect Product to the Right person at the Right time”. And here is when Artificial intelligence (AI) comes into play which is defined as “A branch of computer science dealing with the simulation of intelligent behavior in computers” or “The capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior” But when both marketing and Artificial Intelligence are integrated together they are termed as “ ”, which is a form of marketing leveraging artificial intelligence concept and model such as machine learning and Bayesian network to achieve marketing goals. The main difference from the traditional way of marketing resides in a fact that this type of marketing is performed by computers and algorithm instead of humans completely. This Artificial intelligence marketing provides a set of tools and techniques that enable “ ”, one of the most important concepts used by marketers nowadays. It is centered on the activities of users. Browsing websites of the users are collected through the data mining, which finds patterns in users search history and then it is further used by marketers and advertisers to produce ads that will be more relevant to users and will mostly tempt to a particular user. Behavior targeting has now emerged as one of the main technologies to increase the efficiency and profits of digital marketing, as those properly targeted ads are fetching more consumer interests, even the publishers can charge a premium for behaviorally targeted ads and marketers can achieve the rising demands of their products. It is also known as “ ”. This is one of the ways marketers are integrating AI in their work and expanding globally. AI has become the major demand of time in this fast developing world even in the field of marketing, as one of the most important aspects of marketing called B2B marketing and its future is poised to be touched by Artificial Intelligence. This is the demand of time to integrate marketing with AI because of many reasons some of them are: Gone are those ancient days when marketing influencers find it likely to market their product or service with print media, vivid billboards, and repeated ads on radio and TV channels or even physical appearances from door to door. Now it has been seen that the revenue generated from online ads is far more than old traditional methods. Such real-time statistics highlight how customers (B2B or B2C), are making their online exposure an indivisible part of their lives. Also to address every minute of business customers and reach maximum acquisition, B2B marketing space must be filled with concentrated efforts towards learning their customers. Be it end users or corporate clients, each individual leaves behind a plethora of information through their online clicks and search, live campaigns, chat and e-mail communication, website visits, and purchase decisions. Pyramid of data like this needs a high-caliber automated system like AI that can organize, process it and create powerful insight after learning about customer mindset, demographics, and their behavior. As customers are true heroes and work as an inspiration for establishing new channels of communications developed through unique innovations. So here the proactive use of AI robots and algorithms will enable B2B marketers to assemble and organize more data to properly imbibe the functioning of their existing business network made up of customers, suppliers, partners, distributors, and marketers. Also, optimizing the cost is one of the dreadful challenges of marketing. But with the entire business cult getting online, machine learning sounds like a great choice to tackle marketing challenges pertaining to cost. Various real-time scenarios of this machine learning are: Now formulating an equation using this Machine learning with marketing we get: The equation stands to be right as the adoption of artificial intelligence in B2B marketing will not help marketers and business, but it will also touch customers by empowering them more than they can expect. This is where marketers can reap insights from their intelligent software and transform it into smart purchase decisions for customers. So, in the nutshell, it can be well said that marketing geared up with AI can act as the controller in the market. Marketers can forecast what customer/buyer wish for and can satisfy them specifically with what they demand or even more or simply to say artificial intelligence can drive marketing prophecy. Also, top marketing influencers confirm that smart people (marketers) combined with machine learning will be the future of B2B marketing. As marketers will harvest new opportunities by using artificial intelligence in B2B sales and marketing by being the great storyteller. ****   \n \n We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

An automaton in a Research Laboratory says to a Scientist, “Warning! Error Occurred Reformatting Hard Disk Now!” The scientist panics. Automaton says again,” Ha! Ha! Just Kidding! “. Funny Right. Before some of you say that this joke isn’t realistic, “How can an Automaton tell you a joke?” But what if I tell you in 2017, “Sofia” the robot made a joke on the show Good Morning Britain! Who thought computers could tell us a joke? Hard to believe? Well, the idea of giving computers human-enjoy thinking has now become a reality. Thanks to the technological advancement in AI in the last decade. Before diving deep into how AI can impact the future of work, let’s begin with the simple question: what’s AI? Artificial Intelligence provides machines the power to think from data. The machine uses the patterns and trends found in data and makes its decision, but cannot create thought beyond these patterns and trends. With the rise of AI, humans are divided into one question. Are machines human’s friend or foe? Tech executives and politicians on conference stages, campaign rallies, and even science fiction Hollywood movies like Carbon Black, Westworld, Minority Report, and Ex Machina have given their take on this question. Some believe AI will help us solve problems while others believe that the rise of AI will result in destruction and maybe the end of the world, we all know. Stephen Hawking made it no secret of his concern about the rise of superhuman AI that eventually would escape earth to a new planet. No, this isn’t a plot of Black Mirror. Right now, Superhumans may not be a reality, but AI is. “Homo Deus”, the emergence of the new Digital God using AI. God must also worry, as AI might take his job. Here’s some Career Advice, have you thought about being a Robot? The fear that AI would automate all jobs in the future eventually leaving all humans jobless has been daunting for many workers today. Statistics show that nearly 37% of workers worry about losing their jobs to robots. While another thought that many people believe is that though the rise of AI with result in automating most of the jobs in the future, however, it also will create millions of new job opportunities. AI is already replacing most manual and repetitive tasks. For example, buying a metro ticket or a movie ticket is now almost a human-less interaction. Each year the number of industrial robot jobs increases by 14 %. At this rate, it’s predicted that the 20 million jobs in the manufacturing industry will be replaced by robots due to automation. The coronavirus pandemic and recession have boosted the demand for automation. The Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Software industry has experienced an increase of 19.53% in the year 2021. Coronavirus pandemic has increased interest in technology that reduces human contact as minimal for making workplaces safe. Our workplaces will look much different in the next five to ten years. AI will help humans in simplifying repetitive processes. The two most important catalysts for the future of work are the two D’s- Digitization and Datafication. Digitalization is converting data to digital formats (computer-readable). For example, text to Html, analog video to YouTube video. Digitization helps in increasing data exponentially. Datafication is quantifying human life to data and improving the data-driven business model. By 2025, it is forecasted that the digital transformation space will build in a $3,294 billion industry! One thing is clear, no data, no future of work. What we find is that the future of data and the future of work will go hand in hand. The total volume of data in the datasphere that is created, captured, copied, and consumed in the world is predicted to reach 175 zettabytes by 2025. To give you a much better picture for understanding, if we represent the digital universe as stacks of tablets, there would be 27.25 stacks from earth to the moon. It’s time to prepare for the data-dominated future as Industry 4.0/Fourth Industrial Revolution has begun. So, let’s see how artificial intelligence will affect the following fields: Human Resource: Nowadays, recruiters use AI-powered tools for hiring workers. Using these tools, recruiters get insights into a candidate’s skills, personality and even check whether the candidate is fit for the organization. For example, the company AllyO first identifies high-potential candidates through assessment and smart screening, and then automatically schedules interviews using AI. HR departments at large companies receive hundreds of resumes for a job opening. Entry-level roles focusing on screening and scheduling will be automated. AI will automate specific HR jobs, not HR roles. A Deloitte study found that AI has already eliminated 800,000 low-skilled jobs in the UK, but 3.5 million new jobs were also created. Roles that focus on complex decisions like resolving disputes within a department will continue to be a very human endeavor. Finance and Accounting: In 2015, a report from Accenture named “Finance 2020: death by digital” predicted that 40 percent of transactional accounting work would be automated by 2020. Has technology replaced the human factor? Well, AI has created new jobs involving managing the AI system and using the information to create insights. For example, accounting software has already automated bookkeeping tasks that used to be done by humans, but that’s only opened the door for former bookkeepers to learn skills needed to run and manage the software for employers and clients. Advisors are another crucial role of the accounting and finance team. Using the information gained from transactions in books, the team creates insights to improve business strategy. Owing to automation, the team spends more time analyzing numbers. Marketing and Sales: Marketing automation has helped companies strategize the proper utilization of the company’s resources, managing time, and achieving budget targets. Marketing automation has helped to draw conclusions at a scale no marketer ever would. In this process, marketers and machines both excel in different parts. Marketers using AI tools drive more conversions in less time. Human Intelligence with technology can help identify the right customers to talk to and at the right time. Modern Marketers understand the insights from any marketing campaign and create it into effective messaging. Engineering: Technology is changing in a blink of an eye. The technologies used five years ago in the industry have become obsolete today. Engineers will have to keep up with the technological advancements and keep upgrading their skills to stay relevant in the industry. Learning to work alongside machines and designing work such that interaction better humans and machines are better are going to be important skills for engineers in the future. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the rise of the industrial revolution centuries led to millions of people losing their jobs because of scientific advancements. But that also ended in creating millions of other jobs. Statisticians have said, when automation destroys jobs, people find new ones. Thus, AI holds a more optimistic picture for the future. In the future, AI is not going to replace humans, rather make jobs more humane. AI will disrupt millions of middle and entry-level jobs in the next few years but will also create millions of additional jobs and help to boost economies.

The telecommunications sector will meet this growing demand with the shift to 5G and beyond, allowing seamless connectivity for IoT devices and building the foundation for smart cities and driverless vehicles. The way we interact, work and live has been completely changed by the internet. The demand for the Internet has grown exponentially since its inception, and this trend is expected to continue in the coming years. By 2035, the world’s population will be even more connected, and India, the largest economy and technology hub, will have a major impact on the development of the digital environment worldwide. This article examines how demand for the Internet is growing, how it affects communication, and how new options are emerging that will transform the digital world by 2035. An IoE ecosystem will be created by integrating AI into the Internet, personalizing user experiences and improving services. To shape this digital future and foster a connected, secure and efficient global community, this article highlights India’s role as a technology hub. The Internet has influenced many facets of modern culture and has become an indispensable component of it. The need for Internet access has increased dramatically as a result of the widespread use of smartphones, IoT devices, and other technological breakthroughs. It is anticipated that almost everyone will have access to the Internet by 2035, regardless of location. Due to the exponential rise in data consumption that will ensue, a reliable communications infrastructure will be needed to meet the rising demands. Our communication habits will change dramatically as Internet usage increases. As consumers prefer fast and digital communication techniques, traditional communication channels like telephones and postal services will continue to lose prominence. The communication landscape will be dominated by social media platforms, messaging services, and video conferencing capabilities, allowing for global real-time connections. The telecommunications sector is moving toward 5G and beyond to meet the growth in Internet demand. 5G networks, which provide unmatched data rates and low latency, will be widely used by 2035. The Internet of Things (IoT) will be seamlessly connected thanks to this technical advance, ushering in the era of smart cities and driverless automobiles. The telecommunications sector is preparing to take a huge step forward with the launch of 5G technology and beyond as the demand for Internet connectivity continues to soar. 5G networks are anticipated to offer unheard-of data rates, decreased latency, and increased network capacity by the year 2035. Satellite Internet will revolutionize isolated and rural locations with limited access to existing communication infrastructure. The most remote regions of India and the entire world will have access to high-speed Internet thanks to breakthroughs in satellite technology and falling costs. By doing this, the digital divide will be closed, and underserved areas will experience economic growth. When it comes to bridging the connectivity gap between remote rural areas and urban areas, satellite Internet will be essential. Satellite technology will make it possible for communities without or with little access to traditional communication infrastructure to engage in the digital economy and have access to government programs, healthcare services, and educational resources. Blockchain technology will replace the current centralized Internet model by 2035. The decentralized nature of blockchain will improve data ownership, security, and privacy. Users’ access to and control over their data will expand, which will boost confidence in online interactions and transactions. Finance, healthcare, and supply chain are just a few of the industries that decentralized apps (D Apps) will disrupt. Online information and transactions will become transparent and unchangeable thanks to the blockchain’s decentralized ledger architecture. Blockchain will improve consumer, business, and institutional trust by supplying a tamper-proof history of data, eliminating the need for middlemen in a number of operations. Quantum Internet will offer an unheard-of level of security as cyber threats become more advanced. Unbreakable encryption provided by quantum communication protects sensitive data from future cyberattacks. Quantum networks will be an essential part of critical infrastructure and data-sensitive sectors by 2035. QKD, a cutting-edge cryptographic method that permits the secure exchange of encryption keys between parties, will be used by Quantum Internet. Because QKD uses the principles of quantum mechanics, unlike conventional encryption techniques, it is nearly impossible for eavesdroppers to intercept or decode the transferred keys. An ecosystem known as the Internet of Everything (IoE) will be created by the deep integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into the Internet. Personalization of user experiences, service optimization, and work automation are all possible with AI-powered hardware and software. The IoE will transform sectors like healthcare, education, and entertainment by 2035. As AI becomes increasingly ingrained in the IoE and Internet environment, issues over data privacy will grow more pressing. For legislators and tech businesses, finding a balance between providing individualized experiences and safeguarding user data will be quite difficult. Through individualized learning routes and intelligent tutoring systems, AI will improve the learning experience in the education industry. Platforms for adaptive learning will meet the needs of each individual student, improving inclusivity and effectiveness in the classroom. There will be a greater emphasis on utilizing these technologies to solve climate change as the IoE and AI grow in popularity. AI-powered systems will be used to manage natural resources, monitor environmental changes, and optimize energy consumption. The likelihood of cyberwarfare and cyberattacks on a global and national level increases as Internet usage increases. Cybersecurity will dominate national security agendas by 2035. In order to safeguard vital infrastructure, avoid data breaches, and combat online threats posed by adversaries, governments and companies will make significant investments in cyber defence and offensive capabilities. By 2035, machine learning algorithms will be used by AI-powered cybersecurity systems to quickly identify and counteract advanced cyber threats. The ability of these intelligent systems to recognize and mitigate potential threats will continuously increase as they learn from fresh attack patterns. Bridging the gap between urban and rural communities is one of the major obstacles in the fight against the digital divide. Governments and organizations will put into place thorough plans by 2035 to bring affordable and dependable Internet connection to remote areas. The immense prospects provided by the Internet will be accessible to even the most remote locations thanks to projects like satellite Internet, community networks, and mobile connectivity projects. Mobile Internet will be essential for providing last-mile connection by 2035. Internet access will be possible in places where traditional fixed-line infrastructure is not practical thanks to mobile networks and technological breakthroughs. People in remote areas will be able to access information, education, and employment prospects thanks to mobile data subscriptions and reasonably priced cell phones. By the year 2035, both in India and globally, the communications landscape will be shaped by the explosive growth of Internet demand. There will be an unprecedented amount of connectivity and data consumption as a result of the digital revolution, the expansion of smart gadgets, the Internet of Things, and developing technologies.

Dreaming about the things you are going to do when u go back to school and things you are going to speak with your friends in those noisy teachers fewer classrooms and hallways during breaks. This is how everyone’s summer break ends either with a lot of excitement or a huge load of fear. But this was not the case with the last summer break, a change happened- a big change! There was neither excitement nor fear in students. Leaves were extended but no happiness, homework deadline got moved-no relief, you may wonder what’s wrong with them… but it was just like providing a key to a million-dollar but empty mansion on a deserted island. No games, no friends, no teachers, you and your family worrying about one of the deadliest viruses and its effect on your loved ones. One of the memorable parts of childhood were grabbed from these students and got merely substituted by e-learning Google defines that e-learning means learning conducted via electronic media, typically on the internet. As you can see its learning is conducted via media, not schooling conducted via media. The first challenge every student face that is e-learning becomes a site for learning. Schools are not just made for learning. We have caching institutes for that. We don’t need schools to perform them. Students find it difficult to adapt to the new condition that was imposed on them suddenly. Students feel that schools conduct lectures that look like taking Wikipedia pages. Students suffer from understanding concepts. People think that this will allow them to communicate effectively and directly with their teachers for doubt and help in front of the whole class. People may think that this will help them to speak up, Be bolder. No, it will certainly not help them speak up. Necessities alone never change people, sometimes they need motivation, a boost, someone to give up the confidence to speak up, and these things can be never given by the e-learning platforms. They would rather keep their doubt unsolved. It’s not the same. No UHD screen can replace the blackboard. A physical presence of the teacher and direct eye-to-board contact while those classroom gets filled with the voice of your teachers while you sit with your friend who you can lean on whenever you get a doubt or lack behind. This could never be compared with a desk a chair laptop and earphones. Virtuality is made to ease reality not to replace it. It was not easy for teachers either, workload got doubled even though their pay gets reduced. Working from home, teaching kids with the workspace they have, talking to a screen rather than 30 faces is really difficult and teachers have been working and doing a great job in making students feel more comfortable. Taking care of their family during pandemics and students is never an easy job. Teachers suffer a lot to make learning fun for students. All they can do is to try and accept that this will never be a classroom and learn to live with the fact that teaching is going to be hard this way in the same way learning is and try to give their best from both sides In-order to achieve e-learning as a reliable source of education. Self-motivation among students to learn new things and stay focused on the class rather than performing any other activities on the electronic gadgets remain hard. Even many adults find it difficult to sit through a 2-hour meeting and how can you expect a student half ur age to attend a class for 6 to 8 hours a day. Even though there are breaks in-between but the interest in learning starts to fade away as the day passes. One has the ultimate power to control the teacher virtually, from the voice level to the screen ratio, and even has an ultimate choice whether he wants to look to the teacher while photosynthesis. One finds its hard-to-find online classes intriguing even though teacher try their level best in making a class so much interesting. But one can’t just expect a teacher to be Walt Disney all the time, creating a movie or animation for every class just to make it interesting. I would rather sit in the hall of 100 to hear a motivational speaker speak rather than hear the recording in my 20000 RS music player. The audio quality may be superficial but the transfer of energy, the liveliness, and the feel of you learning something directly from the speaker as you can see them move, project that information out at you directly is something one will feel and miss after sitting through 8-hour classes for a week. But the teachers continued effects in making these classes intriguing for the kids and students adapting to the new method of education is happening. Even though they were time-consuming but students after a year came to understand that education has taken a drastic change and try to cope up with that. Teachers’ excellent effort and students’ bit of self-motivation and a guiding way from parents can revolutionize the way of learning. However, it may never overtake schooling but can be a safer and reliable approach to education. On March 23, 2020, covid cases appeared in India, now 18 Nov 2021. Even After a year school has not turned to normal. Accepting that this phase should not affect the learning flow of any students is the main part of students. Teachers ensure that every child learns but as the distance increases the way we push from our side to reach out complete knowledge becomes necessary and students adapting to a new system is time consuming but one day this will change. And students will accept the pros of the system over the cons. Let’s self-motivate ourselves to teach and learn. And hustle knowledge.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/how-artificial-intelligence-can-deliver-real-value-to-companies/", "title": "How Artificial Intelligence can deliver real value to companies? | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "For the majority of us Indians, the first encounter with Artificial Intelligence (AI) was perhaps when Arnold Schwarzenegger displayed undying machismo in ‘The Terminator’. Unless AI & relating Technology was your Business, James Cameron was perhaps the person who introduced AI to the Indian masses and provided a reference of what AI is capable of! Well, in an extremely entertaining way! The concept of AI can be termed as a Wine aged well. Much of the things which would have been considered as fantasies yesterday can be at least comprehended today if not already a reality. The World is aging and hence the percentage Working Population is rapidly declining. But the Population is not and definitely not the Resources available. This is specifically where Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning will play a pivotal role as they can be instrumental in adapting to latest Labor dynamics, increase overall Productivity, have a competitive advantage and ultimately help in Survival! The timeline of the evolution of Artificial Intelligence, and its sister areas is illustrated via the below graphic:   The role of Artificial Intelligence is to ease Human Life and bring in incremental changes in processes involving Human life. The role of Artificial Intelligence is perhaps best explained by Andrew Ng, the Co-founder of Google Brain and Coursera, the online MOOC pioneer. He says  The Automotive Industry was perhaps the first Industry to realize the potential of AI and United States and Japan, the two warhorses of Automobiles post-WWII era were perhaps the first Countries to actually work towards realizing this potential. The New Jersey factory of General Motors was one of the first Assembly lines to host an Automotive Arm. These Automotive Arm has now become a pre-requisite of any Assembly line. The car which would have taken 2 months to build can be built within a day just because of Automation. A complete AI based process would do wonders. The weakness of Achilles lied in his heels while the biggest weakness of Automobile Industry has been Humans, the very species it intends to serve. The majority of the Car Accidents that happen on the face of the earth have a Human error in its cause. The Human error may serve in the Invention of Penicillin but definitely does not help in making Roads safer. That is where Driverless Cars come into the picture. Let us take an example of Uber (or Ola or Didi Chuxing). What are the attributes where they lack and what are the factors that prevent maximum monetization? The answer lies in the Drivers. Uber has not only bore the brunt of misappropriating behaviors of its Drivers but also seen Drivers unionizing to get a bigger piece of the Pie. The scenario of Uber moving completely to Autonomous driving vehicles not only increases the Safety of the System but also helps in maximizing Profits. Although a definite possibility of the future, it will take some time to get implemented till we see Level-5 Autonomy Vehicles being rolled out. The Innovations in the Healthcare Industry were often restricted to digitizing and ‘automating’ the manual tasks to make them easier. The machines involved were not self-learning and would Doctor’s Interpretation. But the advent of AI has restructured the Healthcare Industry. The next 20-30 years will see personalization of Healthcare Industry. Diagnosis, Therapy, Diet, and Treatment would not require Doctors and would be taken care entirely by Machines. Where does the value lie for the Companies in this? Again the same cause and effect diagram is what we can imagine. AI-powered Healthcare firms will eliminate a large number of middlemen which are often prone to error. The majority of the deaths caused by Cancer are due to failure to detect early signs and act on it. This won’t be the case if the powers of IBM Watson are made available to the general public. There will be no complaints even if IBM charges a premium for it. Not only this, with a doctor to patient ratio of 1:921, this specifically serves India well. As it solves the problem of Accessibility and Quality. This is synonymous with the recent success of Reliance Jio, whose success can be attributed to the one most important parameter – Accessibility. One of the most important problems that Social Media giants face today is of users leaving their platform or not staying long enough on the Platform. This may be because they find the content uninteresting, irrelevant, or even because of abuses and threat to privacy. These parameters are important to these Social Media companies because their Revenue Models revolve around them. What Artificial Intelligence can do is curate the content for a particular User according to his liking and protect his Privacy to an extent he/she demands. This will, in turn, ensure that Users continue to use their platform more and more and their activity in-turn monetizes it. AI-powered companies apply machine learning techniques like logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, etc. to help companies study the buying behavior of the Customer and extract maximum value out of them. Another major field where Artificial Intelligence will create a definite Value is in the field of Finance and Wealth Management. The major problem that Banks face today is dealing with the non-performing Assets. What AI can do in this case is factually and accurately predict the Credit Risk of an entity thus minimizing the NPAs and maximizing the Profits. Other Problems that many people face is of sub-par returns from their Investments. Artificial Intelligence can ensure that a superior analysis will, in turn, give a bit of better advice to the Customers. This will ensure the elimination of Human Emotional Volatility. Another impact of AI is in the field of Fraud detection where anomalies and patterns are studied to detect fraud and predict fraud. Paypal, the US-based payment giant implemented AI to detect and predict fraud and brought the fraud rate down to 0.32% compared to Industry average of 1.32%. To summarize, Artificial Intelligence can deliver real value by reducing the costs of Human error, Human inefficiencies, Content Customization, increase in production rate, efficient Decision making, and maybe ways which we cannot comprehend as of today. One of the most profound impacts of Artificial Intelligence has been in the field of Human Resources, both in Human Resource Management and the Hiring Processes.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/meta-analysis-in-healthcare-research/", "title": "Meta-Analysis in Healthcare Research | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "In many medical specialties it is common to find that several trials have attempted to answer similar questions about clinical effectiveness; for example: Does the new treatment confer significant benefits compared with the conventional treatment? Often many of the individual trials will fail to show a statistically significant difference between the two treatments. However, when the results from the individual studies are combined using appropriate techniques (meta-analysis), significant benefits of treatment may be shown. A good example of this is a retrospective review of the evidence on the effectiveness of thrombolytic therapy for the prevention of myocardial infarction. The study showed that had meta-analysis been conducted at an early stage, it would have demonstrated the benefits of thrombolytic therapy. Instead, experts remained unaware of its benefits for many years and patients were not given an effective therapy. Meta-analyses are now a hallmark of evidence-based medicine. Systematic review methodology is at the heart of meta-analysis. This stresses the need to take great care to find all the relevant studies (published and unpublished) and to assess the methodological quality of the design and execution of each study. The objective of systematic reviews is to present a balanced and impartial summary of the existing research, enabling decisions on effectiveness to be based on all relevant studies of adequate quality. Frequently, such systematic reviews provide a quantitative (statistical) estimate of net benefit aggregated over all the included studies. Such an approach is termed a meta-analysis. Meta-analysis offers a rational and helpful way of dealing with a number of practical difficulties that beset anyone trying to make sense of effectiveness research. The danger of unsystematic (or narrative) reviews, with only a portion of relevant studies included, is that they could introduce bias. Certain reports may be more likely to be included in a review than those which show no significant differences, and informal synthesis may be tainted by the prior beliefs of the reviewer. Meta-analysis carried out on a rigorous systematic review can overcome these dangers – offering an unbiased synthesis of the empirical data The precision with which the size of any effect can be estimated depends to a large extent on the number of patients studied. Meta-analyses, which combine the results from many trials, have more power to detect small but clinically significant effects. Furthermore, they give more precise estimates of the size of any effects uncovered. This may be especially important when an investigator is looking for beneficial (or deleterious) effects in specific subgroups of patients. Individual studies may contain too few patients in the subgroup of interest to be informative. However, the systematic aggregation of data from many individual studies gives a clearer picture, particularly through use of the technique of meta-regression. It is not simply the case that meta-analyses can always exclude bias more readily than other forms of review. Their advantage also lies in the openness with which good meta-analyses reveal all the decisions that have been taken throughout the process of achieving the final aggregate effect sizes. Thus, good meta-analyses should allow readers to determine for themselves the reasonableness of the decisions taken and their likely impact on the final estimate of effect size. The main requirement for a worthwhile meta-analysis is a well-executed systematic review. However competent the meta-analysis, if the original review was partial, flawed or otherwise unsystematic, then the meta-analysis may provide a precise quantitative estimate that is simply wrong. The main requirement of a systematic review is easier to state than to execute: a complete, unbiased collection of all the original studies of acceptable quality that examine the same therapeutic question. Meta-analysis requires a comprehensive search strategy which interrogates several electronic databases (for example, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials). Hand searching of key journals and checking of the reference lists of papers obtained is also recommended. The search strategy – the key terms used to search the database – needs to be developed with care. The strategy is written as a sequence of requirements: include papers with specified terms, exclude papers that do not meet certain criteria (for example, age or diagnostic group), only include studies that follow certain research designs (for example, randomized controlled trials). Once all relevant studies have been identified, decisions must be taken about which studies are sufficiently well conducted to be worth including. This process may again introduce bias, so good meta-analyses will use explicit and objective criteria for inclusion or rejection of studies on quality grounds. There is a bewildering array of scales for assessing the quality of the individual clinical trials. Perhaps more important than the scale used is whether a scale has been used at all. Once a quality score has been assigned, the impact of excluding low-quality studies can be assessed by sensitivity analysis. Clinical trials commonly present their results as the frequency of some outcome (such as a heart attack or death) in the intervention groups and the control group. For the meta-analysis, these are usually summarized as a ratio of the frequency of the events in the intervention to that in the control group. In the past, the most common summary measure of effect size was the odds ratio, but now the risk ratio (relative risk) can be given. Although they are technically different, the odds ratios and relative risks are usually interpreted in the same way. Thus, a ratio of 2 implies that the defined outcome happens about twice as often in the intervention group as in the control group; an odds ratio of 0.5 implies around a 50% reduction in the defined event in the treated group compared with the controls. The findings from individual studies can be combined using an appropriate statistical method. Separate methods are used for combining odds ratios, relative risks and other outcome measures such as risk difference or hazard ratio. The methods use a similar approach in which the estimate from each study is weighted by the precision of the estimate. A key concern is publication bias, as clinical trials that obtain negative findings (that is, no benefit of treatment) are less likely to be published than those that conclude the treatment is effective. One simple way of assessing the likely presence of publication bias is to examine a funnel plot. Funnel plots display the studies included in the meta-analysis in a plot of effect size against sample size (or some other measure of the extent to which the findings could be affected by the play of chance). If the plot is asymmetric, this suggests that the meta-analysis may have missed some trials – usually smaller studies showing no effect. (Note that asymmetry could also occur if small studies tend to have larger effect size, so the conclusion of publication bias should be a cautious one.) The funnel plot has some limitations; for example, it can sometimes be difficult to detect asymmetry by eye. To help with this, formal statistical methods have been developed to test for heterogeneity. Egger’s regression test has been widely used to test for publication bias. It tests whether small studies tend to have larger effect sizes than would be expected (implying that small studies with small effects have not been published). Another regression test, which in some circumstances may be better than Egger’s test, has been proposed. However, care is needed in the interpretation of the findings whatever test has been used. There is currently no clear direction in recent literature to indicate when to use each test. Because of the many ways in which decisions taken about selection, inclusion, and aggregation of data may affect the main findings, it is usual for meta-analysts to carry out some sensitivity analysis. This explores the ways in which the main findings are changed by varying the approach to aggregation. A good sensitivity analysis will explore, among other things, the effect of excluding various categories of studies; for example, unpublished studies or those of poor quality. It may also examine how consistent the results are across various subgroups (perhaps defined by the patient group, type of intervention or setting). In meta-analyses without sensitivity analyses, the reader has to make guesses about the likely impact of these important factors on the key findings. The usual way of displaying data from a meta-analysis is by a pictorial representation (sometimes known as a Forest plot). A horizontal line (usually the 95% confidence interval) is drawn around each of the studies’ squares to represent the uncertainty of the estimate of the treatment effect. The aggregate effect size obtained by combining all the studies is usually displayed as a diamond. A major concern about meta-analyses is the extent to which they mix studies that are different in kind (heterogeneity). One widely quoted definition of meta-analysis is: ‘a statistical analysis which combines or integrates the results of several independent clinical trials considered by the analyst to be “combinable”’. The key difficulty lies in deciding which sets of studies are ‘combinable’. Clearly, to get a precise answer to a specific question, only studies that exactly match the question should be included. Unfortunately, studies can differ on the types of patient studied (disease severity or co-morbidity), the nature of local healthcare facilities, the intervention given and the primary endpoint (death, disease, disability). These systematic differences between studies can influence the amount of treatment benefit (the effect size), leading to heterogeneity between studies. Meta-analyses should test for the existence of heterogeneity. A test which was commonly used is Cochrane’s Q, a statistic based on the chi-squared test. Unfortunately, this test is thought to have low power; that is, it may sometimes fail to detect heterogeneity when it is present. To try to overcome this, a second test, the statistic, was developed. This test seems attractive because it scores heterogeneity between 0% and 100%. Further, a rule of thumb was proposed, with 25% corresponding to low heterogeneity, 50% to moderate and 75% to high. Subsequent research suggests that this test may also have low power, so it too has to be interpreted cautiously. The presence or absence of heterogeneity influences the subsequent method of analysis. If heterogeneity is absent, then the analysis employs what is termed fixed-effects modeling. This assumes the size of the treatment effect is the same (fixed) across all studies and the variation seen between studies is due only to the play of chance. Random-effects models assume that the treatment effect really does vary between studies. Such models tend to increase the variance of the summary measure, making it more difficult to obtain significant results. When the amount of heterogeneity is large, it may even be inappropriate to calculate an overall summary measure of effect size. Unfortunately, there is no reliable objective measure to decide when pooling is appropriate. Thus, a rule of thumb is given above. The technique of meta-regression is introduced because it provides one way of overcoming the problem of heterogeneity. When heterogeneity is detected, it is important to investigate what may have caused it. Meta-regression is a technique which allows researchers to explore which types of patient-specific factors or study design factors contribute to the heterogeneity. The simplest type of metaregression uses summary data from each trial, such as the average effect size, average disease severity at baseline, and average length of follow-up. This approach is valuable, but it has only limited ability to identify important factors. In particular, it struggles to identify which patient features are related to the size of the treatment effect. Fortunately, another approach, using individual patient data, will give answers to the important question: what types of patients are most likely to benefit from this treatment? Using individual patient data allows much greater flexibility for the analysis, and issues can be explored that were not covered in the published trials. However, obtaining the original patient data from each of the trials is challenging. Assessments of the quality of systematic reviews and meta-analysis often identify limitations in the ways they were conducted. Flaws in the meta-analysis can arise through failure to conduct any of the steps in data collection, analysis, and presentation described above. To summarize: Meta-analyses seek new knowledge from existing data. One test of the validity of this new knowledge is to compare the results from meta-analyses with subsequent findings from large-scale, well-conducted, randomized controlled trials (so-called ‘mega-trials’). The results of such comparisons have, so far, been mixed – good agreement in the majority of cases but some discrepancies in others. For example, one such exercise led to the publication of a paper subtitled ‘Lessons from an “effective, safe, simple intervention” that wasn’t’ (use of intravenous magnesium after heart attacks). With the benefit of hindsight, the flaws in meta-analyses that have been subsequently contradicted by data from mega-trials can often be uncovered. Such post-mortems have led to a number of methodological improvements (such as funnel plots) and a greater understanding of the pitfalls outlined above.

This will save you operational headaches with maintaining systems you don’t need yet. Focus on two things: These will be the backbone for all of your future data infrastructure. This is really important because it unlocks data for the entire organization. With rare exceptions for the most intrepid marketing folks, you’ll never convince your non-technical colleagues to learn Kibana, grep some logs, or to use the obscure syntax of your NoSQL datastore. Providing SQL access enables the entire company to become self-serve analysts, getting your already-stretched engineering team out of the critical path. It also turns everyone into a free QA team for your data. If your primary data store is a relational database such as PostgreSQL or MySQL, this is really simple. You can just set up a read replica, provision access, and you’re all set. With a NoSQL database like ElasticSearch, MongoDB, or DynamoDB, you will need to do more work to convert your data and put it in a SQL database. If you’re new to the data world, we call this an  . If you find that you do need to build your own data pipelines, keep them extremely simple at first. Write a script to periodically dump updates from your database and write them somewhere queryable with SQL. The story for ETL-ing data from 3rd party sources is similar as with NoSQL databases. Use an ETL-as-a-service provider or write a simple script and just deposit your data into a SQL-queryable database. Set up a machine to run your ETL script(s) as daily corn, and you’re off to the races. A good BI tool is an important part of understanding your data. Some great tools to consider are Chartio, Mode Analytics, and Periscope Data — any one of these should work great to get your analytics off the ground. In most cases, you can point these tools directly at your SQL database with a quick configuration and dive right into creating dashboards. At this point, you’ve got more than a few terabytes floating around, and your cron+script ETL is not quite keeping up. Perhaps you’ve proliferated datastores and have a heterogeneous mixture of SQL and NoSQL backends. You may also now have a handful of third parties you’re gathering data from. Finally, you may be starting to have multiple stages in your ETL pipelines with some dependencies between steps. Your first step in this phase should be setting up Airflow to manage your ETL pipelines. Airflow will enable you to schedule jobs at regular intervals and express both temporal and logical dependencies between jobs. It is also a great place in your infrastructure to add job retries, monitoring & alerting for task failures. As your business grows, your ETL pipeline requirements will change significantly. You will need to start building more scalable infrastructure because a single script won’t cut it anymore. Your goals are also likely to expand from simply enabling SQL access to encompass supporting other downstream jobs which process the same data. To address these changing requirements, you’ll want to convert your ETL scripts to run as a distributed job on a cluster. The number of possible solutions here is absolutely overwhelming. I’d strongly recommend starting with Apache Spark. Spark has a huge, very active community, scales well, and is fairly easy to get up and running quickly. On Google Cloud, you can run Spark using Cloud Dataproc. If you’re ingesting data from a relational database, Apache Sqoop is pretty much the standard. At this point, your ETL infrastructure will start to look like pipelined stages of jobs which implement the three ETL verbs: extract data from sources, transform that data to standardized formats on persistent storage, and load it into a SQL-queryable datastore. At this stage, getting all of your data into SQL will remain a priority, but this is the time when you’ll want to start building out a “real” data warehouse. I’d recommend using BigQuery (Google Cloud has it). BigQuery is easy to set up (you can just load records as JSON), supports nested/complex data types, and is fully managed/serverless so you don’t have more infrastructure to maintain. I have a strong preference for BigQuery over Redshift (AWS) due to its serverless design, the simplicity of configuring proper security/auditing, and support for complex types. When thinking about setting up your data warehouse, a convenient pattern is to adopt a 2-stage model, where unprocessed data is landed directly in a set of tables, and a second job post-processes this data into “cleaner” tables. Treat these cleaner tables as an opportunity to create a curated view into your business. For each of the key entities in your business, you should create and curate a table with all of the metrics/KPIs and dimensions that you frequently use to analyze that entity. For example, a “users” table might contain metrics like signup time, number of purchases, and dimensions like geographic location or acquisition channel. At the end of all this, your infrastructure should look something like this: With the right foundations, further growth doesn’t need to be painful. You can often make do simply by throwing hardware at the problem of handling increased data volumes. The most challenging problems in this period are often not just raw scale, but expanding requirements. For example, perhaps you need to support A/B testing, train machine learning models, or pipe transformed data into an ElasticSearch cluster. Some things you may want to consider in this phase: You probably won’t need a distributed queue or near-realtime infrastructure until much later than you might think. It comes with a lot of added complexity to handle all possible failure modes, which isn’t worth it early on. Once the ROI calculus makes sense, try Kafka or Cloud Pub/Sub. With a single monolithic Spark cluster, you’ll almost certainly run into issues with resource contention. When you do, fully elastic job-scoped Spark clusters are worth exploring. At some point, you may want to enforce more granular access controls to your data warehouse data. If you use BigQuery, you can provision dataset access to Google Groups, and programmatically manage that access using Deployment Manager. BigQuery also provides audit logs to understand user queries. Other tools like Apache Knox and Apache Sentry are available for on-prem security solutions. For building in-house A/B testing and supporting experimentation, there, unfortunately, are not many off-the-shelf solutions. Building a pipeline of Spark jobs that populate tables in your data warehouse is probably your best bet. For feature extraction, you can build additional data pipelines in Spark. For the models themselves, you should again start small. Your processed features are likely small enough to fit on one machine so you can train models using sci-kit-learn or TensorFlow. When one machine is no longer enough, you can use Spark MLlib or distributed TensorFlow. ****   \n \n We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

This notorious virus brought about a pandemic that would go on to change the course of humanity.  From that point forth daily lives of everyone across the world changed. With widespread stringent lockdowns, the entire world came to a sharp halt. Not only was the general populace affected, but the pandemic also affected all industries. The pandemic did not even spare critical industries, like healthcare and security. While these industries were required to function for the benefit of society, their daily operations changed drastically. But just as human nature prevails, we rose from this adversity. Post pandemic era saw the rise of new technologies that could aid overcome the restrictions put forth by the pandemic. In this article, we will specifically focus on the healthcare industries, innovations done in the industry, and the impact of those innovations on humans by 2030. Lockdowns initiated to curb the pandemic caused people to stay in their homes at all times. The exception to this was the medical staff who acted as our first line of defense against the pandemic. They not only had to deal with the pandemic but also had to cater to patients suffering from various other ailments. While people were restricted to go out, they still required medical consultation for their issues. This conundrum led to the rise of imparting healthcare facilities over electronic media. Healthcare workers utilized technologies such as video calls and virtual meetings to reach out to the needy. Now, these practices are also known as ‘e-Health’.  As the pandemic raged on, society saw numerous initiatives in the e-health sector. Government-led initiatives like ‘eSanjeevani OPD’ brought government OPD facilities directly to people’s homes.  It should be noted that e-health is not just limited to providing patients with virtual meetings. It encompasses every technology that transitions the traditional healthcare sector into a more accessible electronic form. Keeping with this trend we also saw the use of the Internet of Things (IoT)  to build the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). These internet-connected devices allowed remote monitoring and controlling of facilities imparted to patients.  With the onset of 5G technology, the use of  IoMT has flourished. Some of these solutions include smart devices that monitor an individual’s health metrics. These devices are also capable of sending out alerts in case the metrics do not fall under the acceptable range. Furthermore with the advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning technologies these devices do more than just report. With the help of these technologies, IoMT devices are now capable of intelligently performing actions that keep the metric of a patient in check. Another interesting technology that has found its use in the healthcare industry is ‘Blockchain technology. The technology used as the base for cryptocurrency can also be used to maintain immutable records of patients. Such blockchain solutions are already finding their way into the market Pranacare, is one such India start-up. It is a  platform for doctors driven by blockchain and AI. It offers tools to help dieticians, diabetologists, and cardiac specialists manage their customers and data. It also maintains, tracks, and records patient data and offers a decentralized ledger. The armchair is another organization that combines blockchain technology and the health industry.  The armchair provides an Ethereum-based platform for electronic health records storage. The blockchain is a hybrid public/private network that analyses data using Artificial Intelligence. Will use Ethereum Smart Contracts with the Hyperledger Sawtooth platform to offer a safe method for both patients and providers to access patient data. Existing e-health services also saw a rise during the pandemic. For example, telemedicine visits increased from 1-2% of ambulatory care visits before to the pandemic to 30% of all visits. With customer readiness to adopt telehealth climbing to 66%. According to health systems, up to 40% of primary care appointments might be performed remotely. With the increased penetration of the internet in our daily lives, it has been now critical for companies and start-ups to capture this segment. Keeping in with this agenda, the market has seen a proliferation of companies providing e-health services. Consequently, this industry has also seen an increase.in investments. Between 2019 and 2020, investments in telemedicine solutions quadrupled, rising from $1.1 billion to $3.1 billion. In 2020, total funding for remote patient monitoring (RPM) solutions will have more than quadrupled, rising from $417 million to $941 million. According to e-healthcare investors, RPM solutions for chronic care management are expected to become more popular in the next coming years. Analysts predict that eHealth will increase at a compound annual growth rate of 16.1% from 2022 to 2030, with the eHealth segment expected to generate $61.4 billion in sales in 2023 alone. China is expected to lead the global market followed by the USA. Overall, the e-Health industry is expected to see a boom in investments, providing early investors with a large return for their investments. While e-Health seems like the probable future for the entire healthcare industry, special attention must be given to the security aspect of these services. Being connected to the internet and being made available to all also attracts a lot of nefarious elements. Cybercriminals continually target the healthcare industry. The ransomware attack on AIIMS New Delhi is a prime example of this. Cybercriminals were able to cripple AIIMS systems. For over two weeks this caused massive chaos and confusion among the general public. The pandemic itself saw a large number of healthcare-themed smishing and vishing attacks. Their major motive was to exploit the insecure and scared public and make use of the pandemic to extort money. Every example of a cyberattack on a healthcare industry has always led to massive chaos. Healthcare is considered a critical industry, thereby it needs to be adequately protected. With e-Health on the rise, by 2023 society can also expect a lot of jobs to open in the sector of cyber security in the healthcare industry. e-Health solutions are the need of the hour. Integrating e-Health solutions with up-and-coming technologies can effectively ensure inclusivity for all. Such solutions can bring healthcare facilities to the remotest parts of the earth. With current trends in sight, 2030 is expected to have a large market share occupied by e-Health solutions. Early investors can expect high returns by 2030. With this in mind, special focus should also be given to securing the ever-growing e-health industry.

As digital technologies have become an integral part of daily life, the increasing use of the global Internet has posed new security challenges, both for governments and individuals alike. According to recent studies on cybercrime, researchers have highlighted how the capabilities of digital technologies can facilitate various types of crimes, from identity theft and piracy to hacking and financial fraud. The impact of cybercrime in 2040 is expected to be far-reaching and pervasive, affecting not only individuals but also businesses and governments on a global scale. One of the most significant consequences of cybercrime is the detrimental effect it has on businesses. These crimes can result in significant financial losses, as evidenced by the estimated $600 billion loss experienced in 2018 due to global cybercrimes. This figure highlights the growing menace of cybercrimes, indicating that they are a significant threat to the business community. Organizations face reputational and financial damages as a result of cybercrimes. To address the growing menace of cybercrimes, organizations heavily rely on technology-based solutions to minimize incidents and mitigate their impact. However, the widespread use of the Internet and advancements in mobile technologies have exacerbated the problem. The frequency, sophistication, and impact of cyber threats have increased, posing a global concern for businesses of all sizes and industries. Policymakers and organizations alike have expressed concerns about the potential disruption cybercrime can cause to business and public administration activities. These concerns stem from the difficulty in precisely measuring the impact and increase of cybercrime. Nevertheless, the trends indicate that cybercrime is a pressing issue that requires immediate attention and strategic countermeasures. The destabilizing effects of cybercrimes on businesses cannot be overstated. Beyond the substantial financial losses, organizations also face reputational damage. Customers and stakeholders lose trust and confidence in the business’s ability to protect sensitive information, resulting in a decline in customer loyalty and potential revenue. Additionally, the constant threat of cybercrime creates a sense of vulnerability and uncertainty among businesses, hindering their ability to innovate and grow. Furthermore, cybercrimes have a global reach and can impact businesses in all corners of the world, including developing economies. By the year 2040, the evolution of cybercrime is expected to continue on an upward trajectory. Advancements in technology and the increasing interconnectedness of our digital world will provide cybercriminals with even more opportunities to exploit vulnerabilities and carry out their illicit activities.

Electronic health record and patient treatment data at the hospital, patient, and doctor level were provided. The stored data was complex and unstructured, and it was not easy to drive actionable insights and key drivers from the dataset with performed analysis.  Statistical modeling was performed using r (statistical programming language). Exploratory statistical analysis was used to measure descriptive statistics of the dataset where we have calculated Standard Deviation, mean, trimmed mean, mean absolute deviation, skewness, kurtosis and standard error for continuous data. Contingency tables (univariate and bi-variate) were reported for factor variable types such as gender, and fusion level. Multivariate analyses were performed to build and test the statistical model. Further, the multivariate statistical tests were performed to calculate model estimates, standard errors, z value and pr(>|z|), p-value and odds ratio using logistic regression techniques. This analysis often hypothesizes that a given outcome of interest is affected or influenced by more than one thing. Risk factor for the response variable i.e. Transfusion is calculated by performing a chi-square test on the multivariate logistic regression model. Logistic regression is used for predicting the cause for increased delta hemoglobin and blood transfusion rate. P-value, P<0.05 denoted statistical significance.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/what-is-the-limitation-of-e-learning-classes/", "title": "What is the limitation of e-learning classes? | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "The advent of Covid 19 has boycotted the entire world. An unexpected event in Wuhan, China has spread massively infecting people globally. Although the mortality rate is 4.3%, the spread of the disease is very difficult to contain. As such, the WHO along with many health authorities in the world has joined hands to form some rules and guidelines on how to keep the disease in check. One of the important parts of the regulation that is seen across the world is social distancing. As per WHO regulations all human beings must maintain a distance of 2 meters among themselves to prevent the spread. This has led to a very difficult problem of commuting to work, working in offices, public or social gathering and even contact between human beings has become restricted. The world right now is going through lockdown situations and quarantine and curfews are applicable in most countries. Needless to say that this affected trade and businesses, from local to global. Researchers at (The Conference Board’s ESG Center, 2020) believe that the precautions set by the health departments and WHO must be maintained by every country to keep the virus contained. The most crucial step is to maintain no direct contact with anyone infected. That is also the reason why infected patients in the hospitals are being quarantined. While the health sector is booming and funding is being given globally for research and development. Other economies are getting highly affected. The biggest test for firms to improve on their organization culture and increase employee engagement. Working from home has risen as an opportunity for increased outsourcing and freelance workers. With this point of view researcher (JENKINS, 2020) says that e-commerce businesses are booming now. Online companies and services like social media, online TV viewing services, and even piracy are on the rise, as people are looking for more and more ways to spend their time at home. The education sector too, will not be affected much, as lessons and exams will be conducted online in the time of the pandemic. However, the challenge of the education sector is much more than we thought it was. Unprecedented challenges and situations engulf the students as they struggle to learn their subjects online. One of the major problems that students faced during the transition from person to online is the maintenance and consistency of the rigid schedule that the school or the University maintained. The change process has been too quick on students. While some have adapted to the fast-changing world, most struggle to find their concentration juggling studies in a home environment. Moreover, a crisis of student retention has also cropped up as most students in the international sector had to suddenly pack their belongings and move away from campus, finishing their semester online. This has raised a fundamental question, of those students will return for their summer semester. Moving to more developing countries, the e-learning concept lies elsewhere. Education is now based upon the possession of technological devices, such as smartphones, unlimited internet plans, and laptops or computers. With the mass population being in the low and middle-income group there are gadget shortages in households. Many of the students share laptops, computers, or phones with their parents or siblings to keep up with the coursework. With most parents now running to the electronic stores, less-privileged families are kept on wondering regarding the continuity of education. Not only does e-learning requires preparation, but it is suited for an environment more technologically advanced. Even the educators at government schools seem to be grappling with technological difficulties, causing huge gaps in communication and understanding. Owing to a lack of human interaction, concentration and communication is a problem common to students as well as educators. It must also be said that sound technical knowledge is not possessed by all. Not every student is tech-savvy and limited access to high bandwidth internet causes technical confusion and disruption. Compatibility of operating systems, browsers add another layer of frustration to their daily schedule. With such frequent disruptions in the learning process, students feel isolated with increased stress, anxiety, and depression. Researchers (Youssef, Hallit, Kheir, Obeid, & Hallit, 2020) point out that with growing internet usage in daily activities students displayed addictive behaviors, which in turn showed negative impacts on their mental well-being. A major point stated by the researchers was that there was no unified system of information or a reliable platform that the Universities and the schools could use to impart their classes. This, coupled with the absence of the human factor resulted in an inconsistency in the perception levels of the students. Thus, many of them were diagnosed with “loneliness” and a lack of “connection” with like-minded individuals. Even the quality of friendships was reevaluated in such circumstances. Thus, improper use of e-learning can very well be categorized as factors leading to “Problematic Internet Use”. Concerning behavioral changes, the limitations of e-learning lie in the fact that reading body language is restricted. A survey by Ed Tech Review showed that almost 77% of college students from a span of 800 colleges found e-learning much worse than in-campus learning. This has been majorly due to lack of human interaction, and student engagement in the virtual classrooms. Although the digitized classes are equipped with forums and chat rooms, the absence of a teacher in physical being and the inability to discuss freely on subjects have been crucial issues. Researcher (Y., 2020) explained that classrooms were a center of the technical and methodical process even before the pandemic affected us, and now that we live in the Covid-19 affected world things have changed drastically. In simpler times, the performance of a student would have been based on adaptability, self-motivation, attendance, communication, creativity, dependability, initiative, teamwork, and punctuality. Now, with the online learning situation most of these factors, if not all, have become invalid and do nothing to build up a nourished individual. This leads to maladaptive cognitive behavior leading to reduced enlightenment through education. With a little thought, it can be said that it is a highly dangerous situation with the fate of the world depending on such future generations. As Nassim Nicholas Taleb points out in his book, “Antifragile”, the future of Generation X is extremely fragile and hard to grow from shocks and volatile factors (Taleb, Jan 28, 2014). Furthermore, the age of digitization also brings security issues that now the students need to face. Since the beginning of the outbreak, online platforms have been a breeding ground for cyber-crimes. Many intuitions have fallen prey to such crimes, especially those using Zoom for their online classes. With no care for privacy policy and data storage, these companies store and misuse the data that can be leaked throughout the web. Most concerning of which are the exam papers and results in much before the stipulated date. The University of Sunderland in the UK is one such university that had to cancel its online classes. With many students using their login information a large amount of data would be stored in the cloud environment thereby acting as bait for hackers and phishing activities. While speaking of specific countries, many also face social and economic disturbances, which act as a hindrance to e-learning. In developing countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and many others frequent power shortages and unavailability of the internet are major sources of problems in the education sector. Digital literacy is also a major issue faced by students all over the world. Although Generation Z is fast learners and adept in technology, they still face the nuances of the regular login, submit school work through online portals, and communicate with their classmates and teachers via audio-visual platforms. That being said, none of the parties are educated at online etiquette and their rights and responsibilities while conducting themselves at an online forum. There are a clear set of rules, as to not posting offensive comments, not eating or drinking without permission, and maintaining strict honesty at exams. In India especially, much like the demonetization policy, the sudden change in digitization has caused havoc, as students, as well as teachers, have no clue how to conduct themselves. There is a huge demand for digital etiquettes and integrity, along with self-management techniques that are yet to be explored by those attending and imparting online learning. It is thus, strongly suggested that educational institutions impart digital literacy before conducting any classes online. The most common but overruled problem of all that everyone faces, including students and teachers, are distractions. Whether it is a pet or the nuances of online deliveries, students are constantly distracted by something or the other in their virtual classrooms. Having said that, time management is also an issue that crops up. With a growing mind, it is extremely difficult for young minds to be entirely self-motivated and serious about their routines and virtual discussions. As mentioned earlier disruption of routine and consistency is a challenging factor and can only be brought about with sufficient self-development and awareness. The only way out is unbending focus and creating a to-do list to maintain a focused approach. On the whole, it can be said that Covid-19 has been the most unpredictable event in history, and businesses and even the governments have been having a tough time making crucial decisions. The decision to introduce online classes is one of such steps which are being promoted to reduce human contact to reduce the transmission rate of the virus. However, the concept of online classes is still an area that needs to be perfected and modified considering the socio-economic and political factors of countries. Economists also say that taking the right decision is important and the scope of online learning needs to be strategically explored as far as possible. Due to the virus, online strategy is being promoted. The main goal here is to reduce the engagement of people and contacts. However, engagement in education and communication with a human factor needs to be strongly reconsidered.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/big-data-analytics-through-iot-in-oil-and-gas-industry/", "title": "Big Data Analytics through IoT in Oil and Gas Industry | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "Since the last quarter of 2014 oil prices have plummeted from $100/barrel to less than $30/barrel in 2016. Currently, the oil price is hovering around $70/barrel. Events such as these force the O&G companies to restructure their upstream, midstream and downstream operations. Refinery shutdowns, handling various grades of crude oil, and changing environmental regulations are pushing gross refining margins down to a bare minimum. With the use of IoT, refineries can plan their shutdowns, minimize their downtime, and improve safety record. In fact, refineries that have incorporated IoT in their operations are known as Smart Refineries. IoT is the next step in the evolution of the oil and gas industry. It will play a significant role in lower operating expenses and increase the reliability of the complete production plant. O&G companies around the world are now focussing on IoT to increase overall efficiency and decrease non-productive time as well as costs. Basically, IoT covers the entire value chain of the Oil and Gas industry right from pinpointing the location and exploration of oil wells to refining crude oil to the transportation of oil through pipelines and trucks. From the trillions of dollars that are spent every year on exploration and production (E&P), a very small investment in IoT will reap huge benefits to the entire chain of petroleum operations. The O&G industry loses billions of dollars every year due to non-productive time (NPT). IoT could be used to help reduce NPT events by using real-time data to predict breakdowns and schedule preventative maintenance. This in itself is a huge field of application of IoT. Preventive maintenance (PM) is continuously monitoring certain parameters of the equipment, like vibration, temperature, oil levels and those parameters which are critical to the operation of the equipment, through sensors. The sensors continuously relay real-time data to the receiver. Due to this, the management can accurately determine when there is need of maintenance and the time spent on repairing the machine after it is broken down as well as the greater losses that the organization had to face due to production losses are completely eliminated. In the O&G sector, PM can be used for pumps, compressors, heat exchangers, steam traps, relief valves and all those equipment where doing instrumentation is expensive and difficult and failure of these will lead to high monetary losses. Billions of dollars in savings have been achieved by industries that incorporated IoT in their plants for PM. The Petropiar refinery (Chevron/PDVSA joint venture) in Mejorador Jose, Barcelona, Venezuela, installed predictive management software in conjunction with 4,500 HART field instruments. Using these technologies enabled the refinery to increase production, reduce costs, and improve profitability. Pipelines form the transportation backbone of the O&G industry. For a refinery, there are pipeline networks which scale thousands of kilometers, through rugged lands and mountains caring for the black gold. 24*7 maintenance and supervision of pipelines, in terms of theft, leaks, and corrosion, is very important but with such a huge network this is not possible using wired technology. A pipeline leak will cause oil to leak at a very high flow rate due to the high-pressure differential created and hence immediate leak detection plays a critical role. IoT along with supervisory control and data acquisition(SCADA) plays an immensely important role here. Represented here is the Schneider Electric and Cisco “Smart Connected Pipeline”. It is an open, end-to-end solution for pipeline management that provides future-ready communication architectures for integrated, automated pipeline operations through the use of modern IT technologies . IoT has enabled companies to save millions of dollars in oil losses due to pipeline leaks or theft. A typical petrochemical industry has millions of equipment both large and small and hence it is an asset-intensive industry. The assets can range from Pressure Relief Valves (PRVs) to Heat Exchangers (HE) to huge Distillation Columns (DC). Identifying the efficient working of the larger equipment is easy as all the important parameters like temperature, pressure, flow, and level are wired to the DCS. It is a failure of the smaller equipment that goes unnoticed which over a period of time leads to operational inefficiency. When this smaller equipment is fitted with sensors and transformed into a thing that can send data to the cloud system we get real-time analysis of the complete operation and can quickly identify as to what the issue is. A classic example of asset management for a very critical but non-instrumented part is Emerson’s Process Management’s successful implementation of IoT at Denka Singapore Pte Ltd., a subsidiary of Denka chemical company and one of the world’s largest facilities for continuous polymerizationSteam is a very important heating utility at Denka. As the steam travels through pipes it keeps on condensing after exchanging heat with the concerned process fluid and becomes condensate. This along with non-condensable gases has to be removed and that is done by steam traps. An incorrectly operating steam trap results in lower heating efficiency and escape of live steam; and with industry studies showing steam-trap failure rate in the region of 20% a year (Denka’s was 17%), and given hundreds or even thousands of steam traps in the typical facility, the cost consequences associated with failure are significant . Denka’s approach towards the correction of steam traps was like other process facilities, manual checking by a contractor on an annual basis. This caused a large amount of steam to go waste which created financial as well as energy loss. To automate the laborious process of steam trap monitoring and provide far more frequent updates on the health of steam traps in the Denka plant, Emerson Process Managementarchitected and deployed a native IoT solution. At the equipment level, to sense (i.e. listen for) steam leakage, Emerson’s Rosemount 708 wireless acoustic transmitters configured on a WirelesHART mesh network are attached to 148 of the most critical (high pressure, high capacity) steam traps in the facility. Data collected at the WirelessHART gateways are then transmitted via local telecom provider’s Singtel’s 3G cellular network to analytics software (hosted on a Microsoft Azure cloud platform) for generation of steam trap performance reports4. The acoustic patterns of the condensate are different than the acoustic pattern of steam. It is this change that the sensor monitors and reports. Some of the most fascinating facts about this IoT solution are: After implementing this solution the steam trap failure rate went down from 22% to less than 10% and steam consumption decreased by 7% which will directly impact on increasing the company’s bottom line. This is an example, of smart operations for a leading O&G service provider, taken from Cognizant. The client wanted to increase efficiency and reduce operational costs for thousands of Electric Submersible Pumps (ESPs). ESPs are lowered into boreholes to provide artificial lift when the underground pressure is too weak to force oil to the surface. The engineer needs to periodically reset each pump’s motor speed to optimize production. This depends on the good conditions, such as pressure, viscosity, as well as market prices. Historically, reprogramming the pump profile requires dispatching an engineer to the oilfield, which is not only a waste of time but also a costly proposition that sometimes requires helicopter travel to a dangerous land or sea location. Cognizant began optimizing the problem by conducting an end-to-end analysis of all current systems and processes, identifying opportunities to optimize software, hardware, and processes regarding ESPs. Based on the analysis, Cognizant engineers developed an IoT solution to efficiently gather sensor information, analyze it to determine optimal ESP settings, and program those settings over the network. Using the pump software developed by Cognizant, the client’s engineers could recalibrate pumps over the network, like adjusting motor speed according to the data generated by the software with just a few clicks, instead of traveling to remote oilfields. This can be done for a lot of pumps at the same time thus maximizing the utilization of the oilfield as well as reducing costs. The same interface enables engineers to configure rules to prevent equipment failure — for example, by shutting down equipment when drill temperature reaches 100 degrees and resuming when the temperature falls to 90 degrees . Based on the software the client also received alerts about impending pump failures, thus enabling him to take preventative measures before the pump fails. The repair work is much faster and unplanned breakdowns have reduced thus increasing the productive time as well as customer satisfaction. The importance of IoT can be clearly understood in this case as the efficiency of operations has been greatly increased. There is immense data being generated in the Oil and Gas industry and rightly tapping and understanding. This data will be beneficial. 1http://www2.emersonprocess.com/siteadmincenter/PM%20Articles/SmartRefinerySupplement_Sept2010_Final.pdf http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/solutions/collateral/industry-solutions/Cisco_SchElectric_ConnectedPipeline_SO.pdf https://industrial-iot.com/2016/06/sounding-iiot-application-asia/ https://www.cognizant.com/services-resources/Services/iot_oilfield_services_sensors.pdf   \n \n We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/gaming-disorder-and-effects-of-gaming-on-health/", "title": "Gaming Disorder and Effects of Gaming on Health. | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "Perhaps the virtual illusion has become today’s “New Reality”. Inquisitive about the conclusion? Let’s attempt to vindicate as the outline story unfolds itself. Ever since the concept of gaming floated back in the 1970s a new dimension was put before human beings, intangible in nature, and paradoxically engulfed us since then. It laid an impact on multiple generations in different ways. The last decade witnessed a boom in this industry & with the advancement of technologies in Virtual and Augmented reality, the gaming world has become an integral part of our day to day experiences. With the intent of being regarded as a leisure activity, it has now percolated over various strata and has managed to gather the attention of teenagers and adolescents on a comprehensive scale. As we explored the fabric of our Engineering batch mates, we came across this peculiar guy holding excellent academics with accolades of his names, seemed to be a nerd at a glance and street smart by nature. Concomitance happened to be the reason for experiencing the lifestyle of other personalities that included SAM as well. SAM was not only fascinated by the games but used to spend tirelessly hours and hours in front of the white screen engrossed completely leaving the track of time. As our academics advanced, the intensity of involvement in gaming grew deeper and steadily it turned into addiction in no time. We realized the gravity as we were exposed to his change of behavior and shift of priorities due to his unprecedented absence during our lectures and practical. He was modestly reluctant to share about his whereabouts with his peers. The situation turned grim when he wasn’t able to cope up with the subjects and was socially disturbed while interacting. He was compelled towards the fantasy world and was trapped in the vicious cycle of a never-ending backlog of games. As time progressed his performance turned from bad to worse. He was struggling. It was clear as ice that he had something hidden behind that visage. As sophomores, we were also involved in gaming but soon realized that it does more harm than good. A close cluster of friends decided to lend a helping hand to SAM and as they learned about him, the ground beneath their feet slipped away and froze their brain. He had completely lost the circadian rhythm of his sleep, ran into financial losses, aggression draped him, his relations were tarnished due to the habitual routine, and signs of depression were visible on the upfront. Poker was the tartar that he had caught. The game of cards as most of us would perceive it, rather proved to be the fulcrum of SAM’s near future. In the quest of pleasure through online games, he entered the tunnel of gambling at a very tender age ignoring the risks involved in terms of financial verticals. He was suffering from Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) & his condition deteriorated as days passed by. Apparently, from a healthy individual to a drained skinny one, it took a toll on his physical health. Mental disturbance sucked him and he grew insensitive towards his academics. The psychological negative consequences were due to the combination of online gaming and gambling platforms. During that phase, the peer group (gaming group) gained more influence than parental control.  Days arrived when he ran short of money and went ahead to ask his friends in college for the funds. Since a large amount of money is involved in gambling, a situation exacerbated when SAM had his ethical values on the line and breached his boundaries to satisfy his hunger of gaming and leaped towards illegal means to fund his gambling. The practical project was a crucial part of our Engineering curriculum, under which a team of four members was to be established and is expected to remain intact for a year. SAM was by no means in anyone’s good books. No one in the batch was ready to risk with SAM even though he possessed a brilliant acumen. He was abandoned. We were three friends already and were scouting for the fourth. With mutual consensus, we decided to go ahead with SAM. Initially, we worked together and collaboration seemed to be perfect. Unfortunately, he wasn’t able to clear his backlog exams and had to drop out. At present he plays Poker on a professional level, keeping aside his Engineering career and battling with his conscience that we may not be aware of.   Earlier generations used to spend their time or rather invest their time into activities building up their passion, in some cases they pushed their cognition to such an extreme and contributed to a level that humanity as a whole is in-depth to date. Can we imagine our present without the existence of Sir Edison, Sir Newton, Sir Tesla, Sir Einstein, and many more that were engrossed in their domain and served the necessary impetus for our generation? No one knows that SAM could have been our generation scientist, hadn’t he chose that path.   Not Everyone is SAM but perhaps we could miss our Einstein or Tesla! Maybe our Newton is waiting for the new upgraded version of the game instead of sitting under the tree. Our Mendeleev might be involved in arcade games!  Feels so numb.   Millions of teenagers are involved in online gaming platforms and the community is growing at a rapid rate every year. Presently the prevalence of IGD among the adolescent group was between 1.3% to 19.9% and males reported more prevalence than females. In the fiscal year 2019, there were 300 million online gamers in India. This number was estimated to go up to 440 million gamers by the fiscal year 2022. Overall, India ranked the highest in terms of the growth in online game downloads on app stores with a growth rate of 165 percent between 2016 to 2018. 75% of young people use a mobile phone to play different games, 21% use PC/Laptop. Games like PUBG that promote virtual violence calls for the stern attention of the responsible demographics. As per a study, online games are directly affecting the neurons, leading to chemical imbalance thus causing severe depression and anxiety attacks.   As per the World Health Organization, depression is interrelated to physical and mental health and the word ‘depression’ that didn’t exist decades back has become prevalent among the youth, leading to more stress and dysfunction and worsening the affected person’s life situation. Anything in excess is poison. So are games. So bear in mind all the risks and do not lose track of time while playing online games. A safe and comfortable gaming experience is guaranteed at Slotogate. Just check  , weigh all the pros and cons, and start an amazing gaming adventure unlike any other.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/modeling-simulation-for-drug-development-formulation/", "title": "Modeling & Simulation for Drug Development & Formulation | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "Modeling and simulation (M&S) had already profoundly impacted drug development and formulation. It is used in 90% of all U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug approvals. M&S can influence every phase of the drug development process, including informing commercial decisions about the benefits of bringing a specific drug to market. It can be employed to compare the safety and efficacy of drug candidates; select dose and dose regimen; and identify potential drug-drug and drug-food interactions. M&S can be used in lieu of specific clinical trials, and of importance to those involved in drug formulation, leveraged to demonstrate virtual bioequivalence and obtain biowaivers. Formulation science is an iterative process that can benefit from the ‘predict, learn, confirm and apply’ paradigm underpinning M&S. That paradigm can support and strengthen the overall formulation strategy and inform the numerous alternate formulations that will be developed throughout the development cycle. Formulation selection can profoundly impact drug release, absorption, and metabolism, altering the drug’s pharmacokinetic profile and its pharmacodynamic response. In short, M&S can predict the   performance of drug products. Therefore, its use can improve formulation strategy by aiding scientists in designing a rational and cost-effective approach to formulation development ( ). M&S is an integrative science, which incorporates relationships between disease and biological pathways, drug characteristics, and individual variability, and leverages existing knowledge to guide future research. M&S is an invaluable drug development and formulation tool whose use is actively encouraged by global regulators. An   correlation (IVIVC) has been defined by the FDA as “a predictive mathematical model describing the relationship between an  property of a dosage form and an  response.” The U.S. Pharmacopoeia (USP) defines IVIVC as establishing a rational relationship between a biological property produced by a dosage form, and a physiochemical property of the same dosage form. Developing and optimizing a new drug formulation may involve changes in the drug composition, manufacturing process, use and type of equipment, or batch size. These changes, which can occur often, trigger the need to conduct bioavailability studies to demonstrate ‘equivalence’ between the original accepted formulation and the new one. IVIVC is a biopharmaceutical tool used in drug development and formulation optimization to demonstrate that equivalence. IVIVC technology allows formulation and manufacturing professionals to understand how dissolution parameters affect in vivo drug performance. Dissolution testing is required for all solid oral dosage forms and is used in all phases of development for product release and stability testing. This key analytical test can detect physical changes in an active pharmaceutical ingredient and in the formulated product. This information can be determined quickly, under inexpensive, controlled lab conditions, to serve as a surrogate for the in vivo drug behavior rather than through expensive and time-consuming animal or human bioavailability or bioequivalence (BA or BE) studies. Each BA/BE study replaced by IVIVC analysis can shorten the development cycle by months and save hundreds of thousands of dollars. At the same time, IVIVC gives scientists the requisite knowledge to tweak a drug’s formulation to improve it is in vivo performance with fewer iterations and false starts. There are many instances during a drug’s life cycle when its bioequivalence may need to be established. Its formulation may have been changed to alter its release timing, improve its solubility and absorption, reduce manufacturing costs, extend its shelf life, prevent adverse events such as an upset stomach, improve its taste or smell, or hold the tablet together better. New formulations may be required multiple times during a drug’s life cycle because of changes to the manufacturing supplies, processes, dosage forms, or other factors. In many of these instances, IVIVC can be used to gain a biowaiver for the product. There are two main types of M&S for IVIVC, which when used in a complementary way are considered ‘best practice’. Conventional (statistical) IVIVC. This method uses deconvolution methods such as Wagner-Nelson, Loo-Riegelman, numerical deconvolution, and modified deconvolution to estimate the rate of input of a drug into the systemic circulation of observed plasma drug concentrations from the oral formulation. The FDA guidance for, “Extended Release Oral Dosage Forms: Development, Evaluation, and Application of In Vitro/In Vivo Correlations,” mentions four levels of IVIVC (A, B, C, and D) based on the correlation’s ability to reflect accurately the complete plasma drug concentration-time profile resulting from administering the given dosage form. Level A represents the highest correlation—a point-to-point statistical relationship between the in vitro dissolution rate and in vivo input rate. This approach is used most often to attain biowaivers. While conventional IVIVC is the gold standard for drugs displaying a linear relationship between absorption and dissolution, today’s more complex drugs need alternative modeling approaches. FDA held a workshop in May 2016 where it brought together experts from industry, academia and the regulatory agency to address this need and evaluate mechanistic IVIVC as an evolving technology for drug formulation. During that workshop, the FDA shared its current thinking on mechanism-based absorption M&S and obtained public input on its future application for bioequivalence determination and other regulatory activities for oral drug products. Mechanistic IVIVC (PBPK). This approach considers separately the various mechanisms involved in drug abFigure 1. The role of IVIVC becomes more evident as an important tool in drug development to enhance product and process understanding with the ultimate goal of ensuring consistent performance throughout the product’s life cycle. IVIVC studies are encouraged. – US FDA DRUG DEVELOPMENT & FORMULATION 64 Reprinted from the March 2017 issue of Contract Pharma contractpharma.com sorption, such as transit time, gut wall permeability, gut wall metabolism, and hepatic first-pass metabolism from dissolution rate. By integrating the anatomical and physiological parameters of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract with the physicochemical properties of drug substances, mechanistic IVIVC provides scientists with valuable insights for designing and evaluating the performance and safety of new drug formulations. Mechanistic models provide them with a detailed understanding of the mechanisms involved in absorption and how critical they are for formulation. Mechanistic physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models, such as the Simcyp Simulator, can be used to estimate in vivo dissolution rather than just the systemic input rate, separately accounting for permeation, GI transit and first-pass elimination. This enables the IVIVC to be integrated with other model components to predict in vivo product performance across a specific patient population. Information on transporters and drug metabolic pathways can also be incorporated to model in vivo exposure for a specific body part or the blood. Oral drugs can be classified according to the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS), which is based on the drug’s solubility and permeability. Established in the 1990s and adopted by the FDA in 2000, the BCS provides a regulatory framework for new drug formulations that includes setting dissolution specifications, supporting risk assessment, evaluating post-approval changes, and approving biowaivers. Additionally, the BCS provides a framework for drug development starting with candidate selection and moving to pre-formulation evaluation, solid form selection, and formulation strategies. The body’s ability to absorb oral drug products varies according to physiological and physiochemical factors and the dosage form. The main physiological processes impacting in vivodissolution and absorption within the GI tract are secretion, digestion, and absorption. Underlying those processes are factors including pH; fluid, electrolyte, peptide, protein and digestive enzyme levels; surface area; GI motility and transit time; and bile secretion. The key physiochemical properties of drug molecules are solid particle dissolution, ionization, and solubility. When evaluating dosage form, whether it be immediate, modified, extended or delayed release, the rate and amount of absorption are influenced by the drug design and dissolution profile. The IVIVC method selected depends on the type of product and the objectives of the modeling. With numerical approaches, inter- and intra-subject variability is noise. Including or excluding statistical covariates and/or modifying the study design can minimize that noise. The goal is correlating the in vivo and in vitro data. In contrast, when using a mechanistic approach, separating drug and formulation parameters from subject physiology variability allows associated variabilities to be estimated and projected. This provides an opportunity for population-level simulation and analysis. It also allows scientists to extrapolate from one physiological condition to another, allowing them to answer ‘what if’ questions or virtually assess untested clinical scenarios. Assuming that the IVIVC remains valid for alternate formulations or with other patient physiologies, scientists can expand their product understanding beyond the limits of the available IVIVC dataset and migrate into personalized medicine. Many new drug candidates are poorly soluble, which can severely limit their bioavailability. To ameliorate this issue, a widely used approach is formulating supersaturated drug solutions. However, supersaturated solutions risk precipitation, which can limit the intended benefits of this approach. To address this issue, the U.S. FDA recently awarded Certara’s Simcyp division a grant to develop a mechanistic modeling and simulation framework to predict the behavior of orally-dosed supersaturating drugs and drug products ( ). The U.S. FDA, European Medicines Agency (EMA), Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, and other global regulatory agencies encourage the use of IVIVC. They consider it an important drug development tool, which enhances product and process understanding, with the ultimate goal of ensuring consistent performance throughout the product’s life cycle. FDA recently published a paper, entitled, “Regulatory Experience with In Vivo In VitroCorrelations in New Drug Applications.” The authors discussed using IVIVC for pre-approval (bridging formulations to the pivotal BA/BE batch), and post-approval (formulation, manufacturing site, and process) changes to reduce the need for in vivo bioequivalence studies. They also stressed the value that IVIVC can provide by facilitating decision making during drug development, especially in light of the Quality by Design (QbD) paradigm. QbD, promoted by FDA and EMA, is the concept that product and process performance characteristics are scientifically designed to meet specific objectives, not merely empirically derived from the performance of test batches. IVIVC is leveraged for three purposes: The challenge was developing an IVIVC model for a compound and formulation whose release rate, specific bioavailability, and non-linear relationships would not initially seem to support an IVIVC. The formulation under evaluation was a capsule containing four different types of delayed release beads. Each bead was characterized by a mean dissolution time (MDT) and a time lag (Tlag) and each of the seven formulations under study was comprised of a different ratio of each bead type. The data simulation model contained elements of stomach emptying, intestinal and colon transit, first-pass metabolism in the small intestine and multi-compartment pharmacokinetics. The simulations were done in three stages: simulating dissolution profiles, generating subject PK parameters from a multivariate log-normal distribution, and simulating individual plasma profiles using three kinetic compartments, two absorption compartments with transit times, and proportional error on observations. Using conventional IVIVC methodology with Phoenix IVIVC software, mean plasma profiles for four formulations—10-20 subjects per formulation—were deconvolved using the PK parameters relating to the intravenous kinetics of the compound. The generated series of fraction-absorbed profiles were then overlaid with the dissolution profiles. Reviewing this plot suggested that the slower formulations had greater bioavailability than the fastest release, and the slower the release, the greater the bioavailability. This meant that a simple model could not describe the data well, requiring a custom model to fit the nonlinearity of the compound. Since the Levy plot indicated two-time scales, a bi-linear model was used with an initial lag consistent with a stomach emptying effect together with data representing intestinal transit time switching between phases. Inferences drawn from data exploration can guide IVIVC development. In this case, an initial model was proposed after analyzing two exploratory plots. Model refinement is motivated by consideration of physiological mechanisms and leads to a suitable IVIVC, used for regulatory purposes. This project used mechanistic modeling to establish IVIVC for a controlled release formulation of topiramate. Topiramate’s bioavailability depends on the site of GI absorption. Specifically, topiramate exhibits higher bioavailability in the colon compared to the stomach. For example, dosage can be designed wherein the delayed-release component contains less topiramate than the immediate-release component but that nonetheless achieves a blood plasma concentration equivalent to the immediate-release component. Alternatively, dosage can be designed so that the delayed-release component contains an amount of topiramate equal to that of the immediate-release component yet would achieve a blood plasma concentration greater than that of the immediate release component. To study this, a PBPK model was built using the Simcyp Advanced Dissolution Absorption and Metabolism (ADAM) model. Four formulations—slow, medium and fast release and oral—and multiple immediate release doses were studied, using clinical dataset, formulation and food-drug interaction data. The PBPK approach improved the predictive performance of the IVIVC model, producing a linear IVIVC. The discovery of the differential bioavailability of topiramate allows a more rational drug design based upon the specific therapeutic profiles to be achieved. IVIVC modeling facilitates these alternative formulations. IVIVC M&S plays a strategic role throughout the drug development and formulation process. It allows sponsors to replace expensive, time-consuming BA/BE studies with more efficient, inexpensive IVIVC analyses, shaving months and hundreds of thousands of dollars of development. It also provides scientists with greater product insight, allowing them to change a drug’s formulation to improve both it is in vivo performance and the likelihood of regulatory success.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/how-metaverse-and-vr-can-reform-work-culture/", "title": "How Metaverse and VR can reform work culture? | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "Covid-19 has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization for more than a year. Lockdowns have affected hundreds of millions of people. Many people have made the abrupt transition to working from home, and millions have lost their jobs. The future appears to be uncertain. We have no idea when or if our societies will be able to return to normalcy – or what kind of scars the pandemic will leave. Since then, organizations have been trying to innovate and make the work environment flexible and immersive. One of those recent innovations is Metaverse VR. Backed by none other than the pioneer of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, Metaverse VR is rapidly evolving to pave the road for a new futuristic way to work. The Metaverse, touted by the Facebook tycoon, is a complex concept in the digital landscape that promises extraordinary opportunities to billions of people. Modern pioneers are still sketching out a comprehensive definition of the Metaverse. Most people, however, refer to the “metaverse” as a new type of internet experience built around several different technologies. According to Mark, one of the market leaders currently investing in the metaverse concept, the Metaverse is a type of “embodied internet.” It’s something you can immerse yourself in through Virtual Reality or bring to life through Artificial Reality. Although the Metaverse is a rather new phenomenon and a lot is to be worked on yet, its global revenue is predicted to reach around $800 billion in 2024, according to Bloomberg reports. That’s why the big players are already investing billions in the project. Microsoft is working on creating an “enterprise metaverse” and integrating the physical and virtual worlds, as well as developing augmented reality hardware through the HoloLens. It is likely that for work, this will be integrated into existing work productivity applications such as Microsoft Teams. Household social media names are even rebranding to be at the heart of the next computing platform – the Metaverse – establishing themselves as hardware market leaders. Video game developers and platforms, such as Roblox and Fortnite creator Epic Games, are expanding beyond gaming into social experiences and investing heavily in the Metaverse. Epic also owns the Unreal gaming engine, which is used to create virtual environments in games and could be used to create metaverse experiences and environments. One of the most difficult aspects of comprehending the concept of Metaverse is distinguishing it from virtual reality as we know it today. In a nutshell, while VR is a component of the Metaverse, the Metaverse as a whole is much larger. It combines elements of social media, virtual reality, augmented reality, online gaming, and cryptocurrencies. VR can provide true telepresence, which differs from the video conferencing we are used to. The Metaverse is intended to transform the way we consume content, transforming it from a 2D environment to a fully immersive, dynamic 3D environment. The Metaverse, as a shared virtual space, is also expected to change the way people interact with one another by connecting the virtual and physical worlds. For example, it can significantly improve communication with a virtual team, which is critical in a remote work environment. The Metaverse can also transform ordinary video calls into virtual meeting room experiences with a sense of real presence. Creating a shared space can also help with diversity, equity, and inclusion goals. Virtual spaces can help parents (particularly mothers) and Black employees gain equal access to colleagues and managers. Employee training is an extremely costly, time-consuming, and even risky endeavor. If you work in the construction, healthcare, oil, and gas, or energy industries, your training environment will almost certainly include expensive and hazardous equipment, and one mistake might cause substantial damage. Not to mention, after Covid, most workers are scattered across different regions, and proper coordination needs to be developed for teams to work efficiently. Fortunately, companies can now choose much better approaches to employee training. All of the above can now be done in a simulated 3D virtual reality metaverse through. VR simulations can provide hands-on training to hundreds of employees at the same time, even if they are thousands of miles away, and any mistakes they make will not harm them. According to PWC, more than one-third of US manufacturers are already using VR and AR technology or plan to do so within the next three years. VR will definitely play a crucial role in many stages of manufacturing, such as inventory management, design, and prototyping, accident management, etc. C4X, a Manchester-based pharmaceutical company, is effectively using a virtual environment to develop new types of medicines. Their team created 4Sight, a virtual reality visualizer that provides a unique perspective on the efficacy of known compounds and simplifies the drug development process. With the rapid up-gradation of technology, more and more teams are using analytical and simulations to find the right player for their team recruitment. Metaverse can effectively change the managing aspect of the game with the team able to run an infinite number of simulations in the Metaverse to come up with new tactics. For example, Denver Broncos and CEO of SportsVTS, Ted Sundquist, experimented with the idea to train quarterbacks the same way pilots are trained – using VR equipment. 21 players can be placed on the field during VR training to learn passing techniques and develop scheme recognition, pocket presence, decision-making awareness, and other important skills. In addition, the system provides actionable data for use in recruiting, performance evaluation, and return-to-play protocols. People were more likely than ever before to interact and pay online as a result of the pandemic. As a result, fintech adoption has exploded all across the world. Actual cash will not be accepted in the virtual world. There will need to be software and virtual systems to carry out our transactions. Blockchain technology has shown to be secure enough to power peer-to-peer (P2P) payments and scale across all digital payment media. It not only allows for immediate payment and information confirmation, but it also offers a high level of security and can be readily embraced by the public with immediate settlement. In reality, an essential indicator of making the Metaverse as indispensable as real-life will be financial data management and techniques of managing financial transactions supplied by fintech solutions similar to real life. A virtual world where you can buy and sell houses, products, clothing, land, and avatars just like in the real world, implies a massive economic ecosystem. Brokerages and banks in Korea have already begun to construct active virtual environments for their clients, according to the Korea Times in August 2021. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of the newly renamed Meta (formerly Facebook), estimates that the key features of the Metaverse will take five to ten years to become mainstream. However, elements of the Metaverse do exist right now and are slowly being rolled out for public access. Ultra-fast broadband speeds, virtual reality headsets, and persistent always-on online worlds are already available, though not to everyone. But with so many business tycoons investing in the idea, it will be only a few years till we can find out the real potential of The Metaverse. Despite the fact that many questions remain, we can consider the Metaverse to be something large-scale and multifunctional, something that is not limited to the VR/AR experience but is fully revealed when these technologies are used. The Metaverse has been compared to the next generation of the Internet in terms of providing a better user experience, and VR is just one way to get there.

With so many obstacles to contend with, learning is the most difficult. The system of education has changed dramatically all over the world whereby there is an upsurge in the process of e-learning adopting different methods of teaching and learning on digital platforms. struggle to manage to have two meals in a day As of Sept 20, 2020, nearly 1.077 billion learners are affected due to the school’s closure in response to the Outbreak. More than 32 crores of learners have been affected in India due to various limitations and the global lockdown for COVID-19. According to the UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) report, around 14 crores of primary and 13 crores of secondary students are affected, the two most affected states in India.  Billions of unprivileged students out there do not have access to a stable internet connection or they just can’t afford to have a connection along with the increased expenses during the pandemic with the income being unreliable as well. This further increases the education gap between the rich who can afford it and the poor who cannot. The technological advancements can never surpass the essence of classroom learning as they can never match the application-based and practical learning which can only be provided through real classroom learning. It lacks interaction and delivery of expression both ways which can result in a lack of clarity. e-learning lacks the delivery of moral values and knowledge other than academics. One fails to learn the discipline, classroom etiquette, and life skills which are left out while learning via screens. It lacks an emotional connection. Offline learning also involves having different live competitions, debates, street plays, cultural events, exchange of speeches, etc which inject the traits of team spirit, leadership, morale, communication skills and gives them access to a wide range of ideas that get limited in the case of virtual learning. Staying up to date with the transformation in modern technologies can be a task for the students and teachers as well. Let alone those small kids who are yet to start or just started with their journey of school. Lack of motivation among students and teachers to sit in front of the screens for hours to work is yet another challenge faced. It’s quite a tedious task to gather efforts to study in isolation giving rise to the stress and anxiety We can’t even get started with the physical harm of students sitting in front of screens, having no outdoor breaks, and being occupied with loads of work throughout the day. The pressure to concentrate and produce the required results leads to exhaustion. Increased screen time can cause the strain on eyes affecting the eyesight resulting in headaches. The lack of physical activity is taking a toll on students and life, making them mentally frustrated and physically in bad shape. Nonetheless, the rapid increase of e-learning has provided a platform for imparting education to a great extent bridging the challenges posed by the outbreak of the pandemic. The government has always played a major role in contributing towards education and uplifting the economically backward section. However, some issues urgently need to be looked after and need an instant boost for the better future of our millennials. With that being said, I would also like to add that change starts from the individual initiative. We succeed only by uplifting others. We can figure out ways to increase concentration, motivation, so to develop clarity, and also mentor our peers who need help. Practical schedules can be made for students to allow them to have some time away from the screens and indulge in any outdoor activity so to overcome the issues of stress, anxiety, frustration, giving a boost to better mental and physical health. In my opinion, virtual teaching can be a great substitute for the in situation but it can never replace the education imparted through real classroom teaching.

The usage of cell phones and the internet is increasing dramatically over the world, which is generating questions about consumers’ security and privacy. Because of this, all users must understand cybercrime and security. Cybercrime is defined as organised criminal conduct carried out by attackers online. Cybercrime comes in numerous forms, such as fraud, computer viruses, cyberstalking, and others. Due to these, businesses and government organisations are spending more on maintaining and employing professionals in cybercrime. AI has been around for quite a while now and one of its most memorable advancements was the Go game between ‘AlphaGo’, a computer Go program developed by Google DeepMind, and the world champion Lee Se-dol. AlphaGo was able to use its collected data to achieve its goal. The so-called ‘weak AI’ used on AlphaGo is also applied to various fields within cyber security. Over the past years, ransomware has been aiming at innumerable targets. However, its new method of attack now aims at specific targets, where companies, communities, and public institutions are at risk. Companies with strong financial powers are most likely to be their targets as the attackers will be rewarded huge sums of money for their success. Those providing Infra and Database storage, local government and healthcare organizations, are listed as the main targets of ransomware attacks. A supply chain attack is a cyber-attack that affects the organization by targeting less-secure elements in the supply network. Supply Chain attacks were already on the list of the 7 Cybersecurity keywords last year, and still manage to maintain their place. Such attacks will continue to infiltrate the supply chain through third-party systems and services. Therefore, due to its weak security systems, those purchasing third-party vendor products and services must take extra caution. The interest in Cloud Security is on the rise. However, it is pointed out that Cloud computing’s largest vulnerability is the operator’s configuration error. More complex and flexible Cloud systems will eventually lead to a greater number of errors and reveal itself as a target for many cyber attackers. Receiving emails containing malware is not a new thing anymore. The Financial Security Institute warns us how malware email attacks are becoming more cunning and harder to block. Spear Phishing, a traditional method of attack that uses HWP and DOC documents, will not stop this year. Building castles in the air was the perfect phrase to describe how IoT was perceived. However, IoT has now become a part of our lives. People can now watch YouTube on their refrigerators and gas valves can be closed by using Smartphone applications. Many are experiencing an easier lifestyle but are also suffering from many cyber threats. Due to several incidents, Darkweb, which was only known to cyber attackers and security professionals, is now well-known to the public. For example, Warez and Webhard are the two programs in which Netizens in Korea can improve their networking skills but also leads them to be involved in distributing illegal programs and even in cybercrime. There are millions and billions of users and websites in the vast community known as cyberspace. People utilise it for a variety of activities including e-commerce, transactions, shopping, movies, music, and video games. Anyone can simply access anything online in the current technological era owing to an accessible internet connection. As a result, crime in general and cybercrime, in particular, have surged dramatically. Additionally, the faster internet connection has greatly boosted the rate of data circulation. All of these problems are responsible for why cyber security has grown to be a significant issue for society. The government has created several cybercrime-related laws to curb the spread of crime and to protect people’s interests. These laws also provide a defence against cybercrime. Aside from that, the government has established cyber cells in police stations to combat cybercrime as quickly as possible. Cybercrime is an attack that can be harmful to both an individual and a business. There have been several instances where a Cyber Attack led to a data leak that caused a significant loss for a business or a person. These cyber-attacks could have negative effects on the country and the business. The countless instances of cyberattacks that have taken place in India and other nations have necessitated increased security measures. There are four main categories of cybercrime, according to a popular definition—hacking, money, privacy, and cyber-terrorism. Cybercrime is a type of crime in which illegal activities are carried out online or using computers. Cybercrime comes in a variety of forms which involves harassing online users. Cybercrime is the most serious and rapidly expanding type of crime in this day and age. Any person’s life may be negatively impacted for a very long time by becoming a cyber victim. Cybercrimes have a wide range of repercussions on financial and investment activity in digital organisations. One typical tactic used by criminals is to lure online users in by creating attractive websites and sending phoney emails purporting to be from banks or other organisations and asking for personal information. It makes it easier for criminals to access a person’s bank account and personal data. Due to viruses, mail fraud, account hacking, and software piracy, people have been victims of cybercrimes. They also run into problems with unauthorised access mailing, threats from pornographic emails, and video transmission.

Alcohol is highly flammable and the legacy-based system was causing a huge risk at their processing centres and warehouses. The client wanted to design and develop   in place to detect smoke and fire and raise the early-stage alarm to the stakeholders to minimize the overall risk.  An   automated system were designed and implemented to Detect Fire and Smoke and raise early-stage triggers to the stakeholders. Further, a dashboard was created for the decision-maker to live to monitor and controlling of their processing centres and warehouses.  The detection can be done using CNN (Deep Learning) where we train the fire and smoke dataset on different layers of CNN. The early layer of CNN uses to detect edge or simple things of an image and the deeper layer use to detect complex things in the image like texture, object, face, etc. I.          Python II.       Open CV We use the YOLO model to do  Fire and Smoke Detection, the input image will be divided into S * S grid cells, where S is an integer. Suppose the centre of a detected object is located in one of the grid cells, then the classification of the object is determined by the specific grid cells. In YOLO each grid cell will be in charge of predicting B bounding boxes. After calculating, the YOLO model completes the regression of each bounding box. The confidence value indicates whether or not there is an object in the bounding box and how accurate the prediction is. The value calculated by  𝐼𝑂𝑈 .   is the possibility that the object exists in a specific grid cell. When there is an object located in a grid cell,   = 1. One of the major drawbacks of YOLO or any other model is the final on-disk size of the trained model and the number of layers is too large, thus preventing these trained models to run smoothly at a sufficient frame rate on low-cost hardware like Raspberry Pi for real-time fire and smoke detection. To overcome this model, we use your tiny model which takes about 40 mb of disk size and gives a very good frame rate. The Architecture of YOLO tiny only has 23 layers instead of 106 which is present in a YOLO model.       We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

Visualization is another way to perform analyses, Robust Hardware makes it easier to handle volume problems. Platforms like Spark use model plus in-memory computing to create huge performance gains for high volume and diversified data. We have experienced and capable   which can help you in implementing technology in the analysis.  To handle     Flash memory is needed for\ncaching data, especially in dynamic solutions that can parse that data as\neither hot (highly accessed data) or cold (rarely accessed data). Transactional\ndatabases, expanding private cloud using a hybrid model and sampling the process.\nHybrid SAAS/PAAS/LAAS systems along with cloud computation and storage can\ngreatly solve the velocity problem but at the same time, we should take care of security and privacy of data. To get the   the idea here is that you need to create a proper system of factors and data sources, whose analysis will bring the needed insights, and ensure that nothing falls out of scope. Such a system should often include external sources, even if it may be difficult to obtain and analyze external data. For   Examine your cloud providers, all stages of data\nshould be encryption to ensure no sensitive data is leaked, acquire real-time\nsecurity monitoring, restrict access to the data by adding certification or\naccess control to the data entries. We need to develop and design secured\ncertification or access control mechanisms. Inject randomness into the data to\nensure that it satisfies all the privacy goals. Big data, optimization, and implementation into the enterprise can be expensive you have to upgrade your hardware, software and training your staff outsourcing the service is the right step.  You could hire us for\n  in big data. With joint\nefforts, you’ll be able to work out a strategy and, based on that, choose the\nneeded technology stack like. There are also hybrid solutions when parts of\ndata are stored and processed in cloud and parts – on-premises, which can also\nbe cost-effective. And resorting to data lakes or algorithm optimizations (if\ndone properly) can also save money: 1.    can provide cheap storage opportunities for the data you don’t need to analyze at the moment. 2.    , in their turn, can reduce computing power consumption by 5 to 100 times. Or even more. For   a decent architecture of your big data solution. As long as your big data solution can boast such a thing, fewer problems are likely to occur later. Another highly important thing to do is designing your big data algorithms while keeping future upscaling in mind. you also need to plan for your system’s maintenance and support so that any changes related to data growth are properly attended to. And on top of that, holding systematic performance audits can help identify weak spots and timely address them. We can resolve the variety of problems using ETL tools, visualization tools, and OLAP tools and by having a robust infrastructure. It is hard to say just one among them could solely resolve the problem or more than one is needed or there could be some algorithm which could synchronize the data varieties in a uniform format, it depends on particular case or problem. Experience with relational and non -relational database systems is a must. Examples Mysql, Oracle, DB2 and HBase, HDFS, MongoDB, CouchDB, Cassandra, Teradata, etc. We\nhave flawless: Big\nData Tools and Technologies We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

These digital content hubs have already reshaped how we consume media today, and their impact is set to be even more profound in the coming years. The emergence of OTT platforms and their far-reaching effects on the entertainment industry is really going to be very huge one day. The entertainment landscape has undergone a seismic shift with the rise of Over-The-Top (OTT) platforms, and by the year 2040, their influence will have reshaped the industry in profound ways. This article delves into the trajectory of OTT platforms and their far-reaching effects on the entertainment ecosystem.  By 2040, OTT platforms will solidify their status as the dominant players in the entertainment realm. With accessible internet connectivity, audiences from all corners of the globe can access a vast array of content, transcending the geographical boundaries.  OTT platforms have democratized content creation, enabling a diverse range of creators to showcase their work. This will lead to an explosion of niche content, catering to specific interests and cultures that were previously under-represented. Also there has been a lot of Shift in the Consumption Habits of the audiences. Traditional television will continue to lose ground as consumers opt for personalized viewing experiences on OTT platforms. Linear programming will wane as audiences favour on-demand content that fits their schedules and interests. OTT platforms will become hubs for original content production. Exclusive movies, series, and documentaries will attract A-list talent, further blurring the line between cinema and streaming. OTT Platforms also gives one Interactive and Immersive Experience to the audience. With advancements in augmented and virtual reality, OTT platforms may offer immersive viewing experiences, transforming how audiences engage with the content available on the OTT Platforms. OTTs give you Data-Driven Insights. Like if you have watched a Thriller web series it will keep on recommending you all the trending thriller shows streaming on that particular platform. The streaming nature of OTT platforms enables data collection that can inform content creation. Viewer preferences and trends will influence the types of content produced, enhancing user satisfaction. I believe that the rise of OTT may disrupt traditional advertising models also. Advertisers will adapt to targeted, non-intrusive advertising methods, challenging the decades-old commercial break format. I mentioned the word may, because the advertisements said by the OTT platforms say that “if you take a subscription then you won’t be seeing the advertisement. Hence here this is not a sure shot case that is going to happen. Rising of different OTT Platforms is also going to Impact on Theatrical Releases.Theatrical releases might experience changes, with some movies opting for a simultaneous OTT release. The distinction between cinema and streaming premieres could blur. But we can also see this in a positive way, as at the time of COVID many films that were supposed to release in the theatres got releases on the different OTT platforms which was a boon for both the industry and the audience. It is also going to increase Global Connectivity. OTT platforms will bridge cultural gaps, allowing content from different regions to reach global audiences. This exchange of cultural perspectives will enrich the content landscape. Subscription-based models will remain prevalent, but hybrid models could emerge, combining subscriptions with pay-per-view options. Ad-supported free tiers might also coexist. The proliferation of OTT platforms will necessitate robust regulations to ensure content quality, data privacy, and fair competition. OTTs are also reshaping the Industry Landscape as the Traditional studios and networks are adapting or partnering with OTT platforms to stay relevant. As a result the industry’s landscape will continue to shift. As we journey toward 2040, the reign of OTT platforms in the entertainment arena is undeniable. They have revolutionized the way we consume content, placing choice, diversity, and convenience at the forefront. While challenges and transformations lie ahead, the fusion of technology, creativity, and global connectivity promises an era of entertainment that caters to the evolving preferences of audiences worldwide.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/rise-of-cybercrime-and-its-effect-in-upcoming-future/", "title": "Rise of Cybercrime and its Effect in upcoming Future | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "The way we live, work, and communicate has unquestionably changed as a result of the rapid evolution of technology. However, as we gain from digitization, we also leave ourselves vulnerable to cybercrime, a more sinister aspect of innovation. Cybercrime is a worrisome issue that has grown over time, and by the year 2040, its impacts are expected to be considerably more dangerous. This article examines the growing problem of cybercrime and its potentially wide-ranging effects, looking at how it may affect people, businesses, and even countries. Cybercrime, which frequently involves illicit online behaviour, includes a variety of offences like hacking, identity theft, phishing, ransomware attacks, and more. The digital revolution of several industries, including finance, healthcare, and critical infrastructure, has unintentionally given cybercriminals a larger attack surface to find flaws and steal sensitive data. According to experts, cybercrime will have increased in frequency and sophistication by 2040. Cybercriminals will have additional opportunities to compromise networks and steal data as a result of cutting-edge technology like artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Cyberattack complexity is predicted to reach previously unheard-of heights by 2040. The most robust defences will be breached by cybercriminals using cutting-edge technology like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and quantum computing. Attacks will be possible with greater accuracy, speed, and adaptability thanks to these advances. The impacts of cybercrime are felt throughout the entire world economy and go far beyond the digital sphere. The economic effects of cyberattacks may be devastating by 2040. Supply networks, financial systems, and critical infrastructure are all susceptible to breaches that might lead to generalised panic and financial instability. Because of this connection, domino effects and subsequent economic downturns are more likely to occur. The economic effects of cybercrime are expected to be astonishing as its spread grows. Trillions of dollars in revenue could be lost as a result of the financial disruption brought on by cyberattacks on organisations and governments. By 2040, the interconnection of the world’s financial institutions will make it simpler for hackers to wreak economic havoc by crashing stock markets, banking networks, and supply chains. As hackers take advantage of people’s digital footprints, they will become more exposed to identity theft and breaches of their privacy. Identity theft is anticipated to become more sophisticated by 2040 when thieves can obtain personal data from numerous sources using AI and machine learning techniques. Due to the sensitivity of patient data and the vital role it plays in society, the healthcare industry has emerged as a top target for hackers. By 2040, the integration of medical devices with digital systems may reveal weaknesses that would make it possible for cybercriminals to alter medical records, steal patient treatments, or even compromise personal health information. Unprecedented threats to national security are posed by cyberattacks on vital infrastructure, including power grids, transportation networks, and communication networks. Such strikes might have disastrous effects by 2040, upsetting entire countries and unleashing an unprecedented level of turmoil. National security is no longer limited to conventional military threats in the digital age. The field of cyberwarfare will have grown greatly by 2040. Nations might become embroiled in cyber warfare, which might result in data manipulation, espionage, and even virtual sabotage. Cyberattacks have the potential to disrupt political landscapes, undermine defence systems, and impair military communication. Cyberattacks on vital infrastructure, such as power grids, transportation networks, and healthcare institutions, may increase by the year 2040. Due to their interconnectedness with the internet, these systems are more vulnerable to prospective hacks, which might hurt entire societies. These assaults could jeopardise crucial services, healthcare, and public safety. The degradation of individual privacy worsens as technology develops. By 2040, a complex network of interconnected gadgets may enable new levels of data collection and surveillance, raising questions about civil liberties and individual freedoms. Governments, businesses, and even cybercriminals could make use of this circumstance for a variety of reasons, including social engineering and extortion. Beyond national borders, the prevalence of cybercrime can alter global relations. States might interfere with elections, steal intellectual property, and engage in cyber espionage, all of which would exacerbate an already tense situation by sowing distrust and uncertainty. As countries struggle with concerns of cyber sovereignty and digital security, diplomacy may transcend beyond traditional channels and into the domain of cyber talks. To prevent cybercriminals and hold them accountable, governments must implement strict laws and regulatory structures. Cyber rules that encourage responsible behaviour in cyberspace must be established through international collaboration and diplomatic efforts. The fight for digital security becomes more intense as criminality increases. The creation of countermeasures will be essential by 2040 for protecting sensitive data and crucial systems. Businesses and governments will make significant investments in cybersecurity research, AI-driven threat detection, and preventative defence systems. Robust cybersecurity frameworks will develop as a result of the merging of human expertise with machine learning. The development of cybercrime is expected to have a significant social impact on people’s personal and psychological well-being. The ongoing risk of financial loss, data breaches, and digital manipulation may reduce public confidence in digital systems. Living in a constantly unstable digital environment can have a psychological toll that heightens stress, worry, and a lack of faith in technology’s promises. The development of cybercrime and its probable consequences by 2040 provides a gloomy perspective on the difficulties that lie ahead as we look into the future. While technological development has revolutionised our way of life, it has also ushered in a new period of criminal activities. Governments, corporations, and individuals must work together to combat these risks through thorough cybersecurity measures, global collaboration, and responsible technological development. We can work to guarantee a digital future that supports the principles of privacy, trust, and creativity by recognising the scope of the threat, investing in state-of-the-art defence systems, and encouraging a culture of cyber alertness. The battle against the shadowy side of the digital revolution is ongoing, as symbolised by the hashtags #SecureDigitalFuture and #CybercrimeBattle.

The allocation process was previously manual and inefficient, leading to inadequate coach-program matching and inefficient use of coaches’ time. The organization needed a system that could automatically assign coaches to programs based on specific criteria such as coach availability, program preferences, and the number of students enrolled in each program. We developed a custom system that divides the academic year into different terms and assigns coaches to programs based on a set of criteria. The system filters coaches based on their preferences and allocates them to programs efficiently. It ensures that coaches do not have to travel excessively and that their total work time does not exceed a certain threshold. Once a coach is assigned to a program, they are allocated for subsequent program days, ensuring consistency. The development process will involve several stages: In terms of technology, we’ll use Python, a popular language for data analysis and machine learning. We’ll also use the Anaconda distribution, which provides a powerful environment for scientific computing and data analysis. The implementation of the proposed solution has significantly improved the efficiency of the coach allocation process. The system has automated the allocation process, saving valuable time and resources that were previously spent on manual updates. It has also ensured that coaches are allocated in a way that minimizes travel and ensures that their total work time does not exceed a certain threshold.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/how-metaverse-is-shaping-the-future-the-next-big-tech-phenomena/", "title": "How Metaverse is Shaping the Future? | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "The Metaverse is an enormously graded and integrated network of real-time delivered 3D virtual realms that can be encountered simultaneously and insistently by an effectively infinite number of users, each with their own sense of presence and data such as individuality, background, welfare benefits, objects, communications, and payouts. What does Facebook mean by the term “metaverse”? On October 28, 2021, Facebook announced that it had renamed Meta Platforms Inc., or Meta for brief, a name it deliberately chose to monetize on what will undoubtedly be the inevitable future of global connectivity and, possibly, of life itself. “A sense of presence — as if you’re right there with another person or in another place — will become the defining trait of the metaverse.” The ultimate goal of social technology is to feel fully present with another person. That is why, following the announcement, CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in his Founder’s Letter, “We are focused on developing this.” In a 77-minute webcast, Zuckerberg went even farther, giving millions of people around the world a glimpse into what the metaverse will look and feel like. Another major Big Tech player, Microsoft, is attempting to create a metaverse. Mesh is the name of the concept. “Holoportation,” as the business puts it, is one of its most intriguing aspects. Simply, users will be able to project holographic versions of themselves onto other users. Its virtual and augmented realities are best experienced with HoloLens devices, a one-of-a-kind technology that can completely transform the ‘Holoportation’ experience. Mesh, on the other hand, can be accessed using VR headsets, mobile phones, tablets, or computers. Roblox and Fortnite are two more advanced metaverse platforms. The former is really intriguing. Roblox, which debuted in 2006 and has since grown in popularity to the point where more than half of all American children under the age of 16 played it in 2020, is more than simply a game. As an example, consider a fair where guests can play games at stalls. In the virtual world, Roblox is similar to a gigantic fair. Its users can create and monetize their own games on the site by exchanging the virtual currency known as Robux that they earn on the network for real money. Gamers that are serious about their hobby may attest to this. When it was first released in 2000, The Sims, one of the most well-known games of all time, allowed players to experience a life simulation through their virtual avatars. Its numerous sequels and spin-offs have only added to the overall immersion of “living in virtual reality.” The Sims provided a sneak peek into what a future metaverse experience would be like. Second Life was created by Linden Lab, an American technology corporation, in 2003. Virtual reality enthusiasts and professionals alike credit Second Life with technically sowing the metaverse’s seeds. Second Life gives its users the opportunity to live a second life, as the name implies. On the platform, actual people may build 3D virtual avatars and accomplish practically everything they can in the real world. Second Life is a virtual environment where people can communicate with one another and build relationships using their virtual identities. They can plan events, attend them, and express themselves through music and art, as well as interact with virtual objects in the area and even help create virtual structures in Second Life. Religious courses, concerts, and business meetings are all available to them. There are other educational institutions and embassies to consider. The Maldives was the first government to establish a virtual embassy in Second Life in 2007. Second Life’s closed-loop digital currency, the Linden Dollar (not to be confused with a cryptocurrency), can be used to resell virtual objects. Players can engage with each other in a number of games, including the multiplayer online role-playing game World of Warcraft, which was debuted in 2004. This is a type of social network where people establish communities around games. The introduction of virtual reality headsets such as Oculus has given the metaverse a big boost. Games designed specifically for virtual reality headsets are already generating a lot of revenue. From USD 7.92 billion in 2021 to USD 53.44 billion in 2028, the worldwide virtual reality gaming market is expected to rise to USD 53.44 billion. AR takes it a step further by enhancing the user’s sense of reality through the use of technology. It’s similar to gaining more information about a real-world object while seeing it through an AR gadget or headset. Returning to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) flicks featuring Iron Man is a traditional approach to grasp this. Tony Stark (aka our favorite Iron Man) played by Robert Downey Jr. revealed technology that is still beyond our wildest dreams. There are various moments in which he is wearing the Iron Man suit and receiving information and various visualizations of things that he is viewing in real-time on his heads-up display (HUD). That is, to a large extent, AR. After all, these are movies, and Iron Man enters regions of extremely advanced technology that will take decades to reach reality. The speed with which the actual world is attempting to make VR/AR and the metaverse a reality is, however, remarkable. Apple Inc. has already gotten into augmented reality, claiming to have “the world’s largest AR platform.” Several AR apps are available on the App Store, and they may be used for everything from making Snapchat videos more entertaining to examining 3D projects in AR. Nreal, a Chinese augmented reality firm, released the Nreal Light glasses in 2020 and will begin distributing the Nreal Air glasses to China, Japan, and South Korea in December 2021. Furthermore, consumer augmented reality glasses resemble conventional luxury fashion shades, making the enhanced reality experience more thrilling.

Furthermore, consumer augmented reality glasses resemble conventional luxury fashion shades, making the enhanced reality experience more thrilling.  Almost everyone wanted to be a pioneer in the meta-universe when it was first created. On Decentraland, Coca-Cola launched a one-of-a-kind collection of blockchain-based content. You can engage in NFT auctions and win items like friendship cards or sound players that replicate the opening of a Coca-Cola can as part of your online activity. On the website Roblox, Gucci declared its arrival in the meta-universe and sold its digital package for $4,115. NFT certification has been obtained by the owner. It’s worth noting that this bag is more expensive than its physical counterpart, which retails for $3,400 in stores. This appears to be the case today, albeit few women may appreciate NFT bags on their birthdays. From an investing standpoint, Metaverse opens up a slew of new possibilities in the digital real estate market, while simultaneously boosting the value of current technological businesses (Facebook, Tencent, Microsoft, and so on) who are comfortable in the space. Non-tech enterprises, on the other hand, that can benefit from the resource needs of sales and marketing prospects (Coca-Cola, marketing firms) or infrastructure (Nvidia, Qualcomm, and so on) will find chances in Metaverse. New businesses can start from the ground up and continue to flourish in the future. Initial Public Offering (IPO) Success (Decentraland etc.). The value of some Crypto and the entire NFT market may rise as a result of the meta-universe. It has the potential to save expenses and improve the efficiency of businesses. NFT, blockchain, and cryptocurrency all point to the meta world. Of course, there are additional investing prospects in Metaverse. These prospects aren’t as evident as they formerly were. These opportunities will emerge as the future unfolds. In the digital world, the Metaverse may have its own capital market. Investment firms, venture capital firms, SPACs, funds, and small investors will be interested in Metaverse’s tales and investment prospects, which offer high valuations and potential returns. The most widespread misconception regarding Metaverse is that it is a decentralized and interoperable platform, similar to the Internet, on which numerous businesses operate. However, this necessitates the ability to exchange acquired assets (land, property, artwork, and currency) between different locations, which NFT and blockchain systems can facilitate. The company’s marketing activities will be raised to a whole new level, based on the current scenario. A constantly targeted advertisement can be presented to us through our room, which is more complicated than using Instagram to tell the tale (it’s already more complicated than TV commercials). Metaverse will undoubtedly revolutionize the social media environment, given its ability to fundamentally change our lives. Marketing and the creator economy are two of the most fascinating and exciting aspects of the new world. Advertisers will have access to more data than ever before, and complicated placement will be taken to new heights. The information will be more precise and valuable. Brands will need to establish digital twins and either follow or control the meta. The universe’s latest fad. Some have already taken action, and powerful people might consider developing avatars in the meta-universe and collaborating with brands. Meta universe gives creators a new method to interact and communicate with their fans and influencers. Food KOLs can cook with followers, travel specialists can share their experiences, sports KOLs will be surrounded by their supporters, and so on. This is a playground with almost no boundaries on this topic, allowing all players, whether important individuals or businesses, to become pioneers, inventors, and creative geniuses. Meta Universe opens up a world of possibilities for global marketers, and it may be used in practically any business. Influencer marketing, on the other hand, appears to be on the rise in the digital era. Meta Universe, which is as crowded as the internet celebrity sector, now allows everyone to begin their internet-famous path. Simultaneously, it allows established personalities to build two identities in the digital domain, and the brand will attempt to consolidate their Innovation and prestige; after all, fashion firms want to stay ahead of the competition.

The existing predictive models are currently achieving an accuracy of 58%, which is insufficient for meeting the desired performance benchmarks. The objective is to enhance the accuracy of these models to exceed 90%. This requires a comprehensive evaluation and improvement of the model development process, including data quality, feature engineering, algorithm selection, and hyperparameter tuning. The challenge lies in identifying and implementing effective strategies to significantly boost the model’s predictive accuracy while ensuring robustness and generalizability. Our solution architecture is designed to efficiently preprocess financial data, perform feature selection, and train a GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) model for predictive analysis. The architecture comprises the following components: Data Preprocessing: Involves loading the dataset from a CSV file, checking for null values, and performing initial exploratory data analysis (EDA). Feature Selection: Utilizes correlation analysis to identify relevant features and drop irrelevant ones. Model Building: Constructs a GRU model using TensorFlow’s Keras API, consisting of multiple GRU layers followed by dropout regularization and a dense output layer with a sigmoid activation function. Model Evaluation: Evaluates the trained model on test data to measure its performance. Custom Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature selection, and model building. Trained GRU model saved to a file for future use. Handling data variability: Dealing with varying data formats and distributions across different datasets. Feature selection: Identifying relevant features and discarding irrelevant ones to improve model performance. Model optimization: Tuning hyperparameters and optimizing the architecture of the GRU model for better accuracy and generalization. The solution provides a reliable framework for analyzing financial data and making predictions, aiding in strategic decision-making for the business. By accurately predicting financial trends and performance metrics, the solution enables proactive measures to be taken to optimize operations and maximize profitability.

We start with a simple example of confirmatory factor analysis, using the   function, which is a user-friendly function for fitting CFA models. The lavaan package contains a built-in dataset called  . See the help page for this dataset by typing at the R prompt. This is a ‘classic’ dataset that is used in many papers and books on Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), including some manuals of commercial SEM software packages. The data consists of mental ability test scores of seventh- and eighth-grade children from two different schools (Pasteur and Grant-White). In our version of the dataset, only 9 out of the original 26 tests are included. A CFA model that is often proposed for these 9 variables consists of three latent variables (or factors), each with three indicators: The figure below contains a graphical representation of the three-factor model. The corresponding lavaan syntax for specifying this model is as follows: In this example, the model syntax only contains three ‘latent variable definitions’. Each formula has the following format: We call these expressions   because they define how the latent variables are ‘manifested by’ a set of observed (or manifest) variables, often called ‘indicators’. Note that the special “  operator in the middle consists of a sign (“ “) character and a tilde ( ) character next to each other. The reason why this model syntax is so short, is that behind the scenes, the function will take care of several things. First, by default, the factor loading of the first indicator of a latent variable is fixed to 1, thereby fixing the scale of the latent variable. Second, residual variances are added automatically. And third, all exogenous latent variables are correlated by default. This way, the model syntax can be kept concise. On the other hand, the user remains in control, since all this ‘default’ behavior can be overriden and/or switched off. We can enter the model syntax using the single quotes: We can now fit the model as follows: The   function is a dedicated function for fitting confirmatory factor analysis models. The first argument is the user-specified model. The second argument is the dataset that contains the observed variables. Once the model has been fitted, the   function provides a nice summary of the fitted model: The output should look familiar to users of other SEM software. If you find it confusing or esthetically unpleasing, please let us know, and we will try to improve it. The output consists of three parts. The first six lines are called  . The header contains the following information: The next section contains additional fit measures, and is only shown because we use the optional argument  . It starts with the line   and ends with the value for the  . The last section contains the parameter estimates. It starts with information about the standard errors (if the information matrix is expected or observed, and if the standard errors are standard, robust, or based on the bootstrap). Then, it tabulates all free (and fixed) parameters that were included in the model. Typically, first the latent variables are shown, followed by covariances and (residual) variances. The first column ( ) contains the (estimated or fixed) parameter value for each model parameter; the second column ( ) contains the standard error for each estimated parameter; the third column ( ) contains the Wald statistic (which is simply obtained by dividing the parameter value by its standard error), and the last column ( ) contains the p-value for testing the null hypothesis that the parameter equals zero in the population. To wrap up this first example, we summarize the complete code that was needed to fit this three-factor model: Simply copying this code and pasting it in R should work. The syntax illustrates the typical workflow in the lavaan package: Source: http://lavaan.ugent.be/tutorial/cfa.html We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/why-does-your-business-need-a-chatbot/", "title": "Why does your business need a chatbot? | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "Mr. Sakamoto is a bonsai artist, lives downtown Kyoto, Japan. Bonsai is a Japanese art form that is the cultivation of small trees in a small or medium container. He is in this field of business for the last ten years and he loves what he does on a daily basis. People from different cities in Japan, come to buy his artwork. But, in the early stage of his business, he was just another regular Bosai artist. His popularity has increased because of the stories he tells for every art he is selling. His customer immediately loved him for this while buying A Bonsai art. He loved to sell his customer with his artwork and a story related to that product which resurrects his presence through his art in customers. Soon enough his business thrived and nowadays he is always busy. After the digital revolution, although his sales increased, he was not happy. He was not satisfied. Something is eating up his mind day by day. He could not understand what’s the reason behind his remorse. A chatbot is an awesome invention of the digital revolution. It is the real-life embodiment of Customer Engagement. Every business needs this feature- will be an understatement. Because Customer engagement is the base of any business. The chatbot does the exact thing digitally. It helps customers to answer the queries and tell about the product that the business has to offer is a fully automated way with vibrant customizations.             Mr. Sakamoto is running his business for the last fifteen years now. And now he is happy that he was not for the past couple of years. The rationale behind his happiness is the chatbot. Though he has a website and app to sell his Bonsai art, he could not engage with the customers in the way he wanted to. He has trained his employees and apprentices, but they are not providing the same service in the way he does. He was unsatisfied and the chatbot relives him from his sadness. He has done all that at affordable prices in no time. Let’s understand the Mr. Sakamoto’s “Mondai Nai”- perspective about why chatbot is the answer of his problems. This is the fundamental and root cause for which Mr. Sakamoto has to implement the chatbot in the first place. His stories are embedded with each art. The product which he sells needs this story to be with it. His stories which were not been told to all the customers before are now sharing with this chatbot and building the trust between them. We all can agree on this one statement that trust is the most impactful aspect, maybe the best of aspects, in the relation between any customer and business-owner, whether the business is small, medium, or large. Millennials, a word that was not introduced before 1990. The generation which is stuck in between Gen-x and Gen-y. A generation of people accustomed to both digitization and old culture. They are the most targeted audience in this era. What else would be more approachable to this generation than a chatbot? It’s easy, less time consuming to use. Mr. Sakamoto is now one of the few Gen-x persons who can do business with the millennial so easily. Mr. Sakamoto has some employees and apprentices. He has trained them as per his needs. But there is a limit. They can’t deliver the exact things that he can or the way he does. Neither chatbot can do that exactly, it will accurately follow the instructions. Not only the chatbot solve the queries of the customer in his way, but also give a recommendation to the product in the way he wants too. Is there any more attribute he would care about that? Absolutely no! The most expensive thing for any businessman is the return of their customer with an empty hand because of his unavailability. A chatbot is a perfect way to solve it. For Mr. Sakamoto’s customized chatbot is not only present for customers in their availability, but also It was giving the response to the customer in all the time zone, all over the world. Mr. Sakamoto wouldn’t be happier for this feature. In the era of globalization, what is more, helpful than a chatbot? It can be customized in any language. It can be accessed by any human being residing in any part of the world. And at the end of the day, when that foreigner is happy with the buy and the felicitation and says “Arigato” but in his own language, at that moment he feels so warm and happy. Handling a lot of customers is really hard. He assigned employees, but the rate is growing fast. So, in the competition of the market, Mr. Sakamoto took the help of a chatbot. Now this automated customized application is handling a greater number of customers than his employees can do. His business is growing exponentially. Now, when you found out why Mr. Sakamoto is happy and his business is growing in this competitive industry then, do you still have a question in mind that why does your business need a chatbot?

Like an insatiable glutton, the law of averages has come home to roost. We should’ve taken the hint when on the 1  of January, 66 people lost their lives in the Jakarta floods. What followed was like the highlights reel of a disaster movie franchise – a volcanic eruption in The Philippines, irrepressible bushfires in Australia, earthquakes in Russia, Iran, Turkey, India, and China. And speaking of China. 2020 has brought home the fragile mortality of the human race into sharp focus. As global Covid-19 deaths stoutly push past the grim 1 million marks, we have no choice but to question our place in the universe – are we the all-conquering masters of our domain, or mere tourists in a ruthlessly apathetic ecosystem? Is the human race on the ubiquitous three-part literary arc that defines every story, every life, every civilization – ascent, apex, and descent? Maybe when Michael Jackson unveiled his moonwalk in 1983, or when Barack Obama stepped into the White House as President of the United States in 2008, or indeed when MS Dhoni lifted the Cricket World Cup in 2011, we peaked, as a species, and everything since then has been a steady unraveling. 500 years is a long time. For context, the world population in 1500 AD was a mere 461 million. The 16-fold explosion since then is unprecedented in history, but we might just be at the tip of an iceberg. Though fertility rates are dropping and more and more people are foregoing the chance to have babies, we might just have crossed the threshold – the population projections for the year 2050 is 9.8 billion, and for 2100 is a whopping 11.2 billion1. Somewhere out there, Malthus is cackling in his grave. The year 2500 suddenly seems a long way off, and this conversation seems ever-more pertinent today. The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists is not optimistic – the famed Doomsday Clock they maintain is the closest to ‘midnight’ (our proximity to global catastrophe), since its inception in 1947. Global warming? Check. The threat of nuclear war? Check. Ongoing pandemic? Check, check, check. And yet, hope floats, for three reasons. Mankind may just have its back to the wall right now, but there are three shoots of potential that might just help us make it to 2500 AD – the advent of a basket of disruptive technologies (artificial intelligence, bio-enhancement, genetic engineering), the private sector focus on space exploration and terraforming, and good old fashioned human resilience. While the first two factors will no doubt be critical to human survival, it is the third one that we must pin our hopes on – our long-demonstrated history of surviving whatever nature, the universe, or our own self-destructive tendency, throws our way. In the 13  century, in the Italian town of Pisa, an enterprising tinkerer developed the first eyeglasses, for a local friar with weakening eyesight . All of a sudden, there existed an external device that could amplify our senses, a tool that gave us an advantage in survival. Today, LASIK surgeries obviate the need for eyeglasses entirely. Hearing aids give the gift of auditory perception back to those who had gotten used to a world of muffled voices and unheard sounds. The iPhone routinely comes with an augmented reality tool that allows us to measure the length of objects in front of us. But the real science starts where the imagination ends – augmented reality glasses, smart wearables, and virtual reality tools will be ubiquitous in the next few decades. But what after that? Science has the answer, and it’s both thrilling and scary. Artificial intelligence has become the stuff of fable, the filler for all questions left unanswered. But AI, combined with bio-enhancement and genetic engineering, might just lead to the evolution of what some are calling Homo  . Homo  will be smarter, faster, more agile, and better equipped to adapt to what promises to be a world that is VUCA beyond our imaginations. What might such a human being look like? They might have a small chip embedded in their brain that utilizes artificial intelligence for enhanced sensory perception. What does that mean? It means that they would be able to see better, focuses their attention for longer, hears what they want to hear, and communicate the appropriate reaction to the rest of the body. Through a chemical in the blood, this AI chip would be able to demand the appropriate response from the body. Bio-augmentation of limbs and organs, internal and external, would mean that what a person can or cannot do is no longer determined at birth, but can simply be bought. All of a sudden, the average Joe can run faster than Usain Bolt, swim better than Michael Phelps, and…fly? Maybe. Genetic engineering will be the missing link. Already there are feverish conversations about a dystopian future featuring designer babies and a digital divide that simply cannot be overcome because it is inbuilt into one’s DNA. The breakthrough with CRISPR-Cas9 might just be the key to unlock the mysteries of DNA manipulation. So what if there’s no food left? Our body AI will adjust our appetite accordingly. No water? Absorb humidity from the air through specialized pores in the skin. The human being in 2500 AD may not be how we recognize one today. That may be our only shot. SpaceX, led by its mercurial leader Elon Musk, has been the leader here. The SpaceX Mars Programme is based on a very simple premise – as the earth’s closest planet in terms of distance and terrestrial conditions, Mars would be our best bet for colonization. Musk has invested billions of dollars in the Mars Space Programme and remains a fervent believer in the concept. And among tech visionaries, Musk is not alone. Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world, owns Blue Origin, which simply aims to make spaceflight cheaper through incremental technological growth. Bezos, who took an online retailer of books and turned it into an ever-expanding behemoth, is not a man who thinks small. With more and more business leaders finding spaceflight and planetary colonization a tantalizing prospect, there will inevitably be a concerted push to developing an actual colony on another planet. And when the pull-factor to this development starts hitting diminishing returns, there will be the inevitable push factor as global warming and the possible increase in the eruption of pandemics begin to take their toll. It might just become a more feasible option for people to find an alternate home, if not on Mars, then on one of Saturn’s moons. A human colony on Mars sounds like a concept straight out of science fiction, but so did a permanent station in Antarctica until a few decades ago. Mount Everest seemed like an unapproachable summit until someone went ahead and planted a flag at the peak. Today, hundreds of people every year attempt the climb. As spaceflight becomes more reasonable, as the urge to explore supersedes the inertia of investment, we become closer to our best chance of survival – leaving planet earth behind and finding another home, perhaps one more forgiving of our follies. The introduction to this article includes an illustrative list of disasters and misfortunes that have struck the global community  . And yet, we survive. Businesses surge ahead, people adapt to a world of masks and social distancing, the world goes on. Earthquakes, tsunamis, pandemics, we’ve seen them all before and survived, and the human race, in its intrepid exploration of the world, pushes onward and upward. Technological visionaries envision a future that the rest of us cannot see, and then invest money in their vision. Gradually, what seemed unthinkable suddenly becomes real – the moon landing is the best possible example of that. Google launched Google Glass as the first augmented reality wearable technology, and suddenly we could foresee a future with smart eyewear. While the product didn’t quite catch on, that doesn’t mean other companies aren’t trying. Bio-augmentation is already a fast-developing industry, while CRISPR-Cas9, the “genetic scissors” is being held back only by regulatory bottlenecks. How long before the prospect of fiddling with the gene code becomes not a luxury but a necessity? The human spirit, the tendency to survive and thrive at all costs, will eventually win. The human race will survive to 2500, of that there is no doubt. The real question is, will the person who exists in 2500, with bionic chips and a bio-enhanced body structure and a modified genetic code, be called a Homo  Or is Homo  the way forward?

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/will-we-ever-colonize-outer-space/", "title": "Will we ever colonize outer space? | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "Nature has blessed humanity with earth, a rounded globe where all essential necessity lies in the hand of a human. Though in this 21st-century building Space shuttle and exploring space has become an obvious activity among the human raise, now with the inclusion of Start-ups like Space X once dreamed for reaching out at space now is coming true. We all have to agree upon a fact that in the Growth of industrialization we have generated a humungous carbon footprint and colonize at outer space will create a much-needed area for our survival. With time the human race has visualized and has undergone many transformations, and these transformations may for starters were not that effective but were a major role at existence to this age. Be it a natural transformation like shifting of tectonic plates or manmade like Dumping water and damaging water bodies, somehow have affected usual life of humans so creating space of humans is what next humans are eyeing for. All this idea for Colonizing in outer space emerged when NASA was able to launch a space shuttle with a heavy payload in the late 1990s this idea didn’t stir brain at that time but later was like apple eyes when various articles from astronauts and their writeup came into limelight and this idea saw its progression, space exploration was not a new normal, companies were petrified by the number of investments that these kinds of projects ask for. But things change with the entry of PayPal’s owner Elon Musk, in 2002 where he laid stones of Space X, with NASA providing the launchpad for their exploration. Being space travel legitimate there where many bottlenecks knowing the nature of outer space will boost the idea of colonizing, here one has to realize the optimum. But the main target that these company put forward with themself was to not just get into other planet but to get back at earth safely, earlier these projects due to high fund was always subdued and priority was given to the rocket technology. Thus, this unimaginable quest for the search of space was far-fetched though. Now being in 2020 we do not find it out of a place of colonizing outside of space, the kind of emergence of technologies has led to the escalation of spreading the roots of human existence, the plan for reaching out to outer space too plays a key role for this idea too. Proper Planning, Analysing, Organising, and Executing were required for these projects to be successful for deeper know how I would like to mention here an example of Space X, According to them they wud be successful for sending Rockets by 2022 and would able to colonize by 2050, For achieving these vision they have planned a total of 36 times pre-launch of the same rocket which they will be launching by 2020. Not only that they have already placed their star link satellites which will provide the basic network connectivity for their colonized world, they have planned this to that extent that they have targeted a profit of $ 22 billion yearly by 2025. Already they have sent the first manned rocket successfully what Elon musk plan is to create that infrastructure by which going to Mars with cost as a regular air flight ticket all this will lead to better chances for colonizing at another planet. With setting up their commercial flight once started to the red planet it wud just be a stepping stone for the colonizing at the outer space. But the fundamental change that people have to undergo while living on another planet will be a change in gravity and being able to be near to live support if any technical issues arise to their suit until unless we find a similar place like the earth that is the change which humans have to adjust. Aspects like Ultraviolet rays too will play an immense role in the survival, but with the rate of technology expanding and challenging at very boundaries there are not many days left when we find solutions to these aspects but this idea of colonizing has more to do with monetary terms it has been projected that building a colony at space will cost at about $10 Trillian which is more than many countries GDP. Placing that much of an amount and getting funding for such highly anticipated projects is tough. Elon to have addressed with these questions with an open Door he believes that this cost is nothing when we find a route to colonize space and these costs will be justifiable when space exploration will reach new heights. Also, our world is around water and the percentage of land comparison to water is too less. Whereas the population is increasing with the speed and the level of excitement in order to search for new things and the obsession with the new and innovative things never going to finish. Because in the end, we do not satisfy what we have achieved, we are only looking for other things and crave to achieve that. In order to achieve that planning is most crucial stage. As of now we have searched 9 planets but still didn’t shortlisted the outcomes. But according to the 3-decade theory of ELON MUSK, it seems to be possible. As the most important thing to survive is the atmospheric environment, whether is this suitable or not, and in order to make it suitable what steps had to take and maintain the suitable level of oxygen.  The missions are now what everyone is focusing about. Finding the source of water, because its 2  crucial thing which is needed to survive. Apart from the excitement and the things, the threats or the uncertainties are bound to happen like any kind of mammal which could occur during construction or after that. So the security for that or any protection so that uncertainties could be replicated. After the basic things, other factors like what are the natural habitats available there, whether the plants could be grown over there or not. If yes, then what types of plants could survive there. The environment for the animals is safe or not. Because to balance the nature we need all types of animals, natural habitat, even insects and other small things which seems to be ignorable but plays an important role in maintaining the environmental balance. For e.g.  – Ants are among the leading predators of other insects, helping to keep pest populations low.  Ants move approximately the same amount of soil as earthworms, loosening the soil in the process and increasing air and water movement into the ground.  They keep the ecosystem clean of dead insect carcasses and aid in the destruction and decomposition of plant and animal matter. So, every small thing contributes in its own way. Another matter of concern is the level of artificial intelligence and machine learning required to maintain that kind of requirement. Because as the current scenario, we need energy to run any vehicle or even for the robotics. So, the availability of the energy and the source of energy is needed. And apart from this, the heat of sun is equally important in order to maintain the level. Because with artificial air we can survive but not for so long. So, in order to remain healthy as well the calculation has to be done. When thinking about disease, you may have heard in the news about the concern that antibiotics (such as penicillin) – which help fight infections – may eventually stop working. Global health organisations are trying to reduce the use of antibiotics, especially for conditions that aren’t serious. This is because their overuse in recent years means that they’re becoming less effective. But still we can survive without antibiotics. Because there are ways of dealing with diseases caused by bacteria such as isolation which is how they were treated before penicillin. It might sound like something set firmly in the realm of fantasy, but experts in private industry and governments around the world are trying to understand how feasible it would be to establish a lunar base. Some scientists think humans could survive comfortably on the moon. In some ways, the very minimal gravity of the moon might actually be more conducive to life than the microgravity astronauts experience on the International Space Station. Although it hasn’t been formally tested, some experts hypothesize that the small amount of gravitational force put on an astronaut’s body when on the moon could help stem some of the adverse effects like bone-density and muscle loss that space flyers experience while living in microgravity on the International Space Station. By using the moon’s indigenous material, space agencies can save money on the cost of flying pricey missions to and from the moon’s surface. Once on the moon, instead of having to stage costly missions aimed at delivering oxygen and other necessary resources from Earth, experts might be able to actually use the material to manufacture gasses needed to sustain life on the satellite. On earth, we are protected from radioactive solar winds and cosmic rays by our own magnet field known as the magnetosphere. But out in the space, we can’t rely on this type of protection, and in order to make that protection, it could take a lot but yes with more upgraded technology it could achieve. Although till now the approximate value of the project is $10 trillion. But the aim is to make the fare equivalent to the normal air fare. As once we are comfortable with all the resources, securities for uncertainties, risk analysis, and the probability of survival of the human being and many other factors after consideration, then development won’t take much time. Because to construct a building it take normally 8-9 months. Which is totally acceptable. But the main concern is the density of the land, i.e. whether the land has the capacity to bear that much weight or not. And the type of land is adaptable for cultivation or nor.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/will-we-ever-understand-the-nature-of-consciousness/", "title": "Will we ever understand the nature of consciousness? | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "The definition of consciousness has been controversial for centuries, hence it is given the title of the ‘most familiar and yet mysterious aspects of our lives’. An idea of this concept would be an awareness in beings of their surroundings, themselves, and their own perception. The reason this part of our mind remains unascertained is that consciousness isn’t observable, unlike brain matter that is studied scientifically. the physical clarification of awareness is in a general sense incomplete: it doesn’t include what it feels to be the subject, for the subject. There likewise is by all accounts an unbridgeable illustrative gap between the physical world and our consciousness. As suggested by an incident of Eastern and Shamir traditions, consciousness is both universal and primal. Whilst we have made tremendous progress in understanding brain activity over the years, this research hasn’t been able to answer all the questions relating to the nature of emotions and experiences. Beginning within the late nineteenth century, this was a time that once had psychological queries driven by a philosophical understanding of the mind, which was typically equated with consciousness. As a result, the analysis of brain and behavior naturally thought of the role of consciousness in behavioral management by the brain. The Ancient Mayans were among the first to propose a sorted out feeling of each degree of consciousness, its purpose, and its worldly association with mankind. Since consciousness incorporates stimuli from nature as well as interior stimuli, the Mayans trusted it to be the most essential type of existence, equipped for evolution. The Incas, however, thought about consciousness as a movement of mindfulness as well as of worry for others too. John Locke, an early philosopher, said that consciousness, and so individuality, are freelanced of all substances. He also detected that there is no reason to believe that consciousness is stuck to any specific body or mind, or that consciousness cannot be transferred from one body or mind to a different one. Karl Marx, another early thinker, denies the mind-body classification and holds that consciousness is jeopardized by the material eventualities of one’s settings. William James, an American psychologist, differentiated consciousness to a stream – unbroken and continuous despite several changes and shifts. While the main center of a lot of the analysis moved to strictly note cable behaviors throughout the primary half of the twentieth century, analysis of human consciousness has grown staggeringly after the 1950s. In Sigmund Freud’s psychoanalytic theory, we can see that he believed that all three levels of awareness- preconscious, conscious, and unconscious were responsible for one’s behavior and thinking. He believed that the mid itself was divided into three parts- the id, the ego, and the superego. The Id is present at birth, instinctual, and operates according to the pleasure principle. The ego underseals reality and logic and develops out of the id in infancy. Finally, the superego is an internalization of society’s moral standards and responsible for guilt. Now, the Id is regarded as unconscious, whereas the ego and superego are also conscious and preconscious. Freud constantly revised his own clinical qualities researches, however, and didn’t conduct scientific experiments and hence his work is heavily scrutinized, leaving the questions unanswered.   Sigmund Freud’s theory differed from the other psychologists since his theories were more understandable and very easily conveyed to the people. Sigmund Freud’s work and hypotheses helped people shape their perspectives on youth, character, memory, sexuality, and therapy. However, his theories were subject to considerable criticism both now and during his own life. Whilst John Locke and William James took a more practical approach to the mystery by conducting experiments, Sigmund Freud didn’t provide any evidence to support his claims. Today, the essential focal point of consciousness research is on understanding what consciousness implies both biologically and mentally. Issues of interest include phenomena such as perception, blindsight, brainwaves during sleep, and altered states of consciousness produced by psychoactive drugs. A greater part of the test assesses consciousness by approaching human subjects for a verbal report of their encounters. However, to confirm the criticalness of these verbal reports, researchers must contrast them with the action that all the while happens in the brain —that is, they should search for the neural connections of consciousness. Hope is to locate that noticeable action in a specific aspect of the brain, or a particular pattern of global brain activity, will be greatly predictive of consciousness mindfulness. A few brain imaging strategies, for example, EEG and MRI scans, have been utilized for physical proportions of brain activities in these examinations. A few investigations have shown that movement in essential primary sensory areas of the brain isn’t adequate to create consciousness: it is workable for subjects to report an absence of awareness in any event, when areas, for example, the primary visual cortex show clear electrical reactions to a stimulus. Higher brain areas are viewed as all the more encouraging, particularly the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in a range of high order functions. One mainstream theory implicates various examples of brain waves in creating various conditions of consciousness. Analysts can record mind waves, or drawings of electrical movement inside the cerebrum, using an electroencephalograph (EEG) and placing electrodes on the scalp. The four types of brain waves (alpha, beta, theta, and delta) each correspond with one mental state (relaxed, alert, lightly asleep, and deeply asleep) Episodic memory can be regarded as the only form of conscious memory. This is because it is the capacity to consciously remember personally experienced events and situations in the past. The hippocampus located in the brain’s temporal lobe is responsible for this type of memory. Consciousness also plays a part in important memory distinctions. One such distinction is the implicit and explicit characteristics; in which explicit memory is what you consciously know and implicit memory includes events you may not be conscious of. Furthermore, several empirical findings suggest that declarative memory is related to consciousness as well; meaning that the retrieval and formation of this memory are connected to awareness. Working memory operates/maintains consciously perceived information as well since it temporarily stores and tampers with information whilst working on tasks. The current ways of testing this information are lacking in several essential aspects, including spatial resolution, temporal resolution, or scope. Examples of such methods are PET, fMRI, EEG, implanted electrodes, etc. PET and fMRI have temporal resolution problems, EEG is well-known to have localizability difficulties, and implanted electrodes whilst great in temporal and spatial resolution can only test a set number of neurons; that is, they are restricted in scope. Hence, huge numbers of our speculations, while testable on a fundamental level, appear to be difficult to test as of now. Consciousness has an influence on the way we see objects around us, which encourages us to settle on choices about how to communicate with them. Experiencing difficulty perceiving objects is connected to a few problems, for example, agnosia (a failure to decipher visual data), Alzheimer’s disease, and autism. However, we actually don’t comprehend what visual data is basic for the mind to intentionally perceive an object. Several different disorders of consciousness include locked-in syndrome, minimally conscious state, persistent vegetative state, chronic coma, and brain death. Locked-in syndrome, otherwise called pseudo coma, is a condition wherein a patient is aware however can’t move or impart verbally because of complete loss of motion of essentially all voluntary muscles in the body aside from vertical eye developments and squinting. The individual is conscious and is able to speak with eye movements. In a minimally conscious state, the patient has intermittent periods of awareness and wakefulness. Patients need to give restricted, however reproducible indications of consciousness of themself or their current circumstance. This could be following straightforward orders, comprehensible speech, or purposeful conduct. In a persistent vegetative state, the patient has sleep-wake cycles, but lacks awareness, is not able to communicate, and only displays reflexive and non-purposeful behavior. The term refers to an organic body that is able to grow and develop devoid of intellectual activity or social intercourse Like coma, chronic coma results generally from cortical or white-matter harm after neuronal or axonal injury, or from central brainstem sores. Usually, the metabolism in the grey matter decreases to 50-70% of the normal range. The patient lies with eyes shut and doesn’t know about self or environmental factors. Brain death is the irreversible end of all brain activity, and function (including involuntary activity necessary to sustain life). The main cause is total necrosis of the cerebral neurons following loss of brain oxygenation. After brain death the patient lacks any sense of awareness; sleep-wake cycles or behavior, and typically look as if they are dead or are in a deep sleep state. As we can see from the history of scholar’s endeavors to study consciousness empirically, its nature is not one that can be defined using scientific methods. In the past, psychologists such as Descartes came up with dualistic theories that did not line up with the fundamental laws of physics. In the battle between realists and illusionists, taking sides is fundamentally impossible as the topic doesn’t allow for concrete evidence. As we can observe from neural examinations of the brain to detect the causes of consciousness, there is no sensory sector of the brain that is the cause for one to be aware during a certain event even if there are clear signs of a reaction to a stimulus. Similarly, even though consciousness plays a major role in memory, we currently lack the facilities to research it fully. In the future, there is a possibility that we will be able to access such facilities, however, which could allow us to find the neural connections and its ties to mental illness as well. Not only would this help several people by making us aware of the causes of our perspective on certain things, but it would also give us a better chance of recognizing signs of possible mental illness or other issues beforehand. As it seems, researchers continue to study this unknown part of our mind and once we are able to fund and recover from the global pandemic, we will be able to answer one of psychology’s most difficult questions.

In our second example, we will use the built-in   dataset. This is a dataset that has been used by Bollen in his 1989 book on structural equation modeling (and elsewhere). To learn more about the dataset, see its help page and the references therein. The figure below contains a graphical representation of the model that we want to fit. The corresponding lavaan syntax for specifying this model is as follows: In this example, we use three different formula types: latent variabele definitions (using the   operator), regression formulas (using the   operator), and (co)variance formulas (using the   operator). The regression formulas are similar to ordinary formulas in R. The (co)variance formulas typically have the following form: The variables can be either observed or latent variables. If the two variable names are the same, the expression refers to the variance (or residual variance) of that variable. If the two variable names are different, the expression refers to the (residual) covariance among these two variables. The lavaan package automatically makes the distinction between variances and residual variances. In our example, the expression   allows the residual variances of the two observed variables to be correlated. This is sometimes done if it is believed that the two variables have something in common that is not captured by the latent variables. In this case, the two variables refer to identical scores, but measured in two different years (1960 and 1965, respectively). Note that the two expressions   and  , can be combined into the expression  . This is just a shorthand notation. We enter the model syntax as follows: To fit the model and see the results we can type: The function   is very similar to the function  . In fact, the two functions are currently almost identical, but this may change in the future. In the   function, we omitted the   argument. Therefore, you only get the basic chi-square test statistic. The argument   augments the output with standardized parameter values. Two extra columns of standardized parameter values are printed. In the first column (labeled  ), only the latent variables are standardized. In the second column (labeled  ), both latent and observed variables are standardized. The latter is often called the ‘completely standardized solution’.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/how-political-leaders-will-shape-tomorrow-using-big-data-analytics/", "title": "How Political Leaders will Shape Tomorrow using Big Data & Analytics | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "Good governance is key to the growth and progress of any country and this can’t just be achieved through better policymaking but also through its implementation at the ground level in real-time which leads to the overall development of any economy as well as its society. Now the policies are made to benefit society as a whole and our policymakers have the responsibility to implement these decisions for the betterment of people. Due to the emergence of the latest technologies like big data, the effectiveness of these policies can be tracked easily through a real-time collection of data and applying data analytics to measure the effect being achieved or not. For example, through the advent of government initiatives like Digital India, an infrastructure has been set up so that all the government’s services are made available to deliver services online by leveraging the internet and information technology. Political leaders in several states of India have started adopting these technologies for real-time governance across the state to help better address analytical requirements that facilitate state-level decision-making. For example, the Andhra Pradesh government has used digital technology in every department and has launched real-time monitoring where the Chief Minister monitors the performance of each department through CM Office Real-Time Executive (CORE) dashboard as the data is updated automatically. Another such example is in the state of Odisha, where LPG distribution center was opened in areas, which needed them the most and not where LPG companies see the most demand that was done using geospatial analytics. Also, many not-for-profit development organizations like, Swaniti initiative is working on innovative projects on analyzing data for the Indian government. They collect, analyze, and visualize data, which is used to design the development programs. They partnered with the Andhra Pradesh CM’s office to provide the data insights on agriculture that helped design a seed dissemination program. So our political leaders can play an important role in providing effective governance if they leverage these new technologies. Adoption of these big data and analytics can play a major role in the overall development of society. These political leaders can take advantage of the power of IT infrastructure in their respective areas and can use the technology of big data to bring in transparency and accountability in governance. There are many other government institutions and departments like the Income-tax department that can use data analytics to scan through income and expenditure patterns of tax return filers and use it to detect black money generation. Similarly, such tools can also be used to detect terror and crime financing by analyzing the pattern of transactions being done through respective accounts. As tax collection is the major source of income for the government, they can strengthen the IT department with these technologies to counter the tax evasion problems faced by the government and trace the loopholes in the system. Also, they can create a team of data scientists for several departments of government to keep track of functions and administrations so that everyone can come under the lens of performance check with data-based results. Artificial Intelligence-based systems can be used for fraud detection in several government institutions and hence can act upon that also within time to avoid further setbacks. Another example where these systems can be used extensively are in the areas of land and property holding records to detect fraud and forging of documents as most of the documents related to properties are still paper-based, hence it needs to be strengthened through advanced big data and analytics systems to keep a proper track record. Also, it can be used in our judicial system to track the number of pending cases as well as important cases that have been pending for a long time and yet not resolved. Further, it can be used for tracking the healthcare facilities and monitoring their performance through artificial intelligence and data analytics like what is the quality of treatment and facilities being offered to the people in these state-run hospitals and whether the government spending on healthcare is actually utilized or not effectively. Now, these things can be achieved if these political leaders try to inculcate the data-driven decision-making practices in their processes. For this, first, they need to invest more in setting up more data warehouses so that data can be collected and stored as well as bring more data scientists to work on these areas so that administration can be monitored in real-time and government can function on data-based results. As the government spends lots of money on several schemes for public welfare, the effectiveness of these schemes plays a major role in helping society also. Also, the government can partner with several institutions as well as companies working in these fields to provide solutions as well as collaborative research can be done to find the solutions for these real-world problems. Many political parties had already used data analytics in their electoral campaign program to understand the voter stance of a particular demographic and have campaigned accordingly, which has resulted in a better outcome for the electoral results, for example, the 2014 Lok Sabha elections was a prime example of using data-driven techniques for electoral campaigning. So the political leaders also now understand the benefits of using these technologies in decision making and hence if they create an infrastructure to use it on a larger scale in day-to-day governance, a lot of work can be fast-tracked and hence, ease them in administration also. Today, perhaps India owns the largest data repository in the world gathered via digitalization of records for purposes like Aadhaar Card, passports, pan card, Kisan credit card, etc. There is a massive amount of data that government has and if they use it positively then there is a lot of opportunities to apply this data to improve the citizens’ service experience and government efficiency, especially in the delivery of services to the common people. This can also be applied to the farming sector, whereby water demand can be predicted in needy areas having a higher reliance on agriculture and producing in large amounts. Water supply problems soon can also be predicted. Data analytics can be used to get farmers a better price for their agricultural produce by producing crops having higher expected demand or avoiding crops which will have higher failure probability. In the education sector, it can be used to predict the demand for the number of schools, teachers, reading materials, etc. in areas where these facilities are not in reach and their performance can also be monitored by the respective district departments. So basically these technologies have a wide application in major areas like healthcare, education, transportation, agriculture, etc. and if implemented can lead to positive results in the near future in terms of better governance. But this needs to be done with proper planning and proper channels as data security is also a big concern and a data warehouse has the huge challenge of cybersecurity issues because, in case of the data breach, all the data could be affected and might lead to misuse of the data. So if our political parties could leverage these technologies in their respective areas, the benefit is huge and can help them in achieving better governance as well as greater accountability to the people. \n     We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/data-integration-for-marketers/", "title": "Data Integration for Marketers | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "Data integration is the process of combining data from different sources into a single, unified view. Integration begins with the ingestion process and includes steps such as cleansing, ETL mapping, and transformation. Data integration ultimately enables analytics tools to produce effective, actionable business intelligence. When it comes to your marketing technology stack, that source data can be complex. It can live as social ads data in a Facebook data center, or in Excel files on a colleague’s laptop. We’ve found that, on average, marketing departments and agencies use more than 40 different technologies on a daily basis that map to various stages of the customer journey. Before integration, data exist in siloed data centers around the globe, in different formats, and with different protocols for access. Data integration means getting all this data under the same roof– and all speaking the same language.   In his 2016 Cool Vendor report, Gartner analyst Marty Kihn described data integration as the “critical behind-the-scenes part of the marketing stack.” Data integration is like the unifying glue between all of marketing’s performances, outcomes, investments, and stakeholders. By integrating all of your marketing data from your digital campaigns, offline campaigns, web analytics, CRM and post-sale systems (to name a few), marketers can create a seamless and joined a view of the customer journey that aids in smarter decisions making. This is often referred to as the single source of truth. With this single source of truth, marketers can manage and optimize marketing holistically through KPIs, metrics, and dimensions that don’t exist in your individual source systems. These include aggregate metrics such as your total impressions, engagements, and conversions for all of marketing’s programs. They also include efficiency metrics like media spend pace, cost per engagement, customer acquisition cost and marketing ROI. These business-level metrics, commonly viewed through marketing dashboards, all depend on the foundational data integration layer. The relationship between marketers and data integration is unique. This is largely in part because marketing is responsible for attracting, engaging, converting and retaining audiences and customers that move across a myriad of touchpoints. In order to scale marketing’s performance and impact, a connected view is needed to evaluate which programs, channels, campaigns, audiences, etc. are best driving their strategic goals. Getting on a new platform or switching an old one out for a new requires fast data integration to keep the single source of truth moving ahead without interruption. Similarly, new analytics are continually added to different execution systems meaning that current connections need to be flexible to update quickly. And finally, marketers often classify their key metrics and dimensions in like terms across systems– for example, in UTM parameters on landing pages. Marketers need a simple way to line all of those classifications up so that data can be compared from a CMO-level view. When these classifications change or diverge, agile realignment is essential. Data integration is often discussed around the subject of business intelligence or BI. That’s because traditional BI tools were some of the first to take on the task of integrating data from different sources to help business aggregate data from and across different departments. This type of data integration is often characterized as an exhaustive and time-consuming process that requires advanced technical and coding skillsets. In fact, within organizations that possess these scarce talents, data integration can take up to 80% of data scientists’ time as Forbes recently covered. For organizations without these skills, data integration is often handled on a consulting or outsourced basis with specialists. As the number of marketing data sources available (and even required) has exploded, the traditional model of using specialists to build connections is no longer sustainable for business. That’s why most modern analytics tools offer some number of built-in connections to common databases (like Hadoop and BigQuery), and the most-used APIs (like Facebook and Google AdWords). These steps have been a positive direction to making data integration more marketer-friendly, but they’re still not enough to keep pace. The next generation of data integration for marketers takes a hybrid approach that blends API connectors with AI machine learning to automate connections to any data source regardless of an API connection. This approach enables out-of-the-box connectivity for every system and reporting output. Datorama’s data integration is the first to spearhead the hybrid approach for marketers. TotalConnect, for example, is a first-of-its-kind data integration technology that allows you the create API-like connections for any data source using this method The business result for marketers is a single source of truth that can be updated and changed quickly and scaled across markets, teams and other solutions without advanced technical skills. This puts marketing in total control. One important part of data integration is ETL. This is a term that is often used interchangeably with data integration– you may have heard it used by technical practitioners in conversations about business intelligence. Extract, transform and load is three database operations responsible for actually moving your data into a common database. Extraction reads the data in the original database, transformation changes the format so it’s ready for querying and analysis, while loading writes the data to your destination database. ETL is perhaps the most issue-prone part of data integration because an error in one step causes inaccurate or missing data throughout. And each system comes with its own set of unique types of problems it can have. That’s why the right technology is so important in the ETL process, so you can focus less on micromanaging the movement of data and have more time to spend on analysis and decision making.

From using internet banking to application transfer, from digital bill payment to fund management broking sites, or even purchasing online, it all incorporates FinTech. With the smooth rush in new FinTech organizations and startups, the only option for the traditional financial institutions is to embrace the improvised standards. These modern standards are significantly obscuring the limits among financial institutions and other business service providers, brokers, advisers, etc. Financial institutions are coming up with improvised technologies to stay sailing and contributing to the financial technology revolution. Nowadays, numerous organization’s coins are anticipating in their pockets to get approval for contributing towards the financial technological revolution and startup ecosystem with innovative concepts. The ongoing phase of rising FinTech & RegTech depicts the broader sense that it would become the new foundation for the structure of tomorrow by employing the latest technologies at the base of finance to improve things. Since the 2008 crisis, numerous big corporate houses began to contemplating & analyzing the  , and from there, data management is obtaining a robust niche in the financial sector. These efficiencies and effectiveness in the functioning of the banking and business financial systems make services ubiquitous, cost-effective, convenient, adaptable, and unified. Also, few years down the line, notable and significant innovations have been remarked in the payments system, tax filings, banking operations, investment decisions, and in other similar scenarios. The time has come where our smartphones are personal advisors and bankers, assisting & supporting us 24X7. The future of FinTech seems like the entire elimination of paper notes currency and the utilization of digital currency or even, more than that, the decentralized form of money i.e. Cryptocurrencies such as “Bitcoin” and the record-keeping technology called “Blockchain”.  It has revolutionized the idea physiques conceive concerning money and its worth shift in real-time, the digitized world is evolving into “Cashless” businesses, pushing them hesitant to embrace the practice of digital transactions, etc. The tour of progressing cashless begins by demanding customers to pay digitally for goods and services rather than using cash. Considering the future of FinTech, money transfers via smartphones or smart devices are one of the most critical progressions that several customers have embraced. FinTech businesses are now heading the industry and, their integration with vast technologies has become the enabler for more reliable financial services, increased financial inclusion, and many customized products in line with the personnel financial goal, etc. fulfilling, the needs in the most effective manner. ABCD of Technologies called Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Cloud Computing, and Data Science are a few of the crucial technologies accelerating transformation in how an individual executing his/her day-to-day operations and how one is managing their finances. However, numerous traditional institutions have a misconception of perceiving FinTech as a disruptor of their industry rather than encompassing digitized innovation to transform the industry from top to bottom. Nowadays, FinTech is empowering financial services providers to examine untapped Asian & Southern Hemisphere markets and acknowledging users to reach assistance earlier unavailable, via the convenience of a smartphone. It helps FinTechs to grasp and capitalize on underserved markets. These service providers are redefining and reforming the fashion in which corporations and customers are involving in business transactions. In the current scenario, global investments into exploring FinTech ventures are increasing at a high pace. Moreover, India is a high virgin marketplace for FinTech startups because still 40% of the people are not attached to financial institutions and, 87% of transactions are executing in cash. The future is perceived to have a 90% – 95% penetration of internet and mobile usage, which can link small corporates with financial institutions. The application of Fintech AI & blockchain is changing the traditional formal grounds of finances by giving breakthroughs, innovations, and dynamic creativeness. These helps banks to assess credit scores of customers at their fingertips, utilization of blockchain algorithms & consensuses such as the history of calls or shopping to enhance customized performance, and implement more comprehensive admittance to credit. The processing time and cost are enormously faster for the endorsement and sanction of loans by FinTechs and, also, financial institutions are digitizing and speeding up these methods. Therefore, the future likelihoods in digital innovation inevitably offer a mutually exclusive relationship among FinTechs & Financial Institutions. Artificial Intelligence & Blockchain is elaborating & stabilizing the future of FinTech organizations by matching up with the customer expectations and make them to revolving around opportunities. These are Meta-Technologies applied to increase profitability by implementing distinct approaches descended from the   that is beyond human scale. Moreover, these night-loving technologies have grown as a fundamental element of FinTech and, their diversified role is not just only to uncover a customized business solution for corporates but also to protect confidential data and the protection of FinTechs commercial assets, which is very crucial in the world full of a lot of hacking & cyber-attacks. When we talk about Automation and Artificial Intelligence in finance, it becomes essential to be known of the fact that AI is more than just a technical solution and is different from automation. It is utilized for managing, examining, & discovering data, advancing enduring algorithms, and enhancing decision-making. The application of Artificial Intelligence in FinTech for the future can happen in numerous ways and, all are heading towards a better tomorrow such, as meeting more exceptional consumer penuries arising from the digitalization realm. These consumers are becoming less passive and more imperious. All they want is the technology upgrading at lightning speed at the particular moment. Artificial Intelligence might be changing the prospective customers are thinking about the forthcoming financial industry.  It is more focused at the customer level or, say a “Customer-Centric” approach. AI has a prospect in shaping the future of the finance industry according to the demand of the new generation because of its potential to mitigate and eradicate human errors in financial processing or transactions, helps to manage effective customer relationships, etc. It is thriving to modify the digitized waves in such a manner that fits users’ lives. We can comprehend that AI can be a substantial game-changer in encouraging efficiency and in inscribing obscure FinTech dilemmas. Blockchain enactment dominates the future of FinTech as a distributed public financial ledger system. Blockchain technology has been recognized as a decentralized framework, which allows inherent global blocks of chain to store digital data and acts as a preventive measure in terms of confidentiality. However, FinTech firms are proceeding forward with blockchain development to be more than just a data storage service. Moreover, it is supporting the most eye-catching decentralized form of future currency called “Cryptocurrency”. As innovations are happening within and outside the finance industry, blockchain is evolving more from a security viewpoint to the speed of financial transactions. It also brings transparency to the actions executed by nodes in the blockchain. Nowadays, the number of financial transactions are happening all around the world from numerous remote places that need someone to authenticate the transactions. So here, the blockchain operates as a third-party affirmation player that enables interested parties to write more customized smart contracts and letting all people to trace the documentation over a reliable interface. Blockchain is continuing to improve the future value system and enable the self-expression of humankind. It is a future approach of accounting as well as data organization. The future of FinTech with Blockchain is novel & sustainable. It will be going as the mainstream and can be executed on a large computation. It leads to the future evolvement of Cryptocurrencies. Nowadays, it helps in overseeing financial transactions on a real-time basis that assist financial institutions to access relevant financial information within seconds. In the current scenario, Fintech AI & blockchain are the most ardent tech trends. However, the two tech trends have profoundly opposed development & the working domain, but the confluence of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain would become a quite impressive and powerful combination. The amalgamation can uncover novel acumens into the finance domain. Embedding the two tech trends has the potential to manage data in techniques nevermore previously conceived achievable. The blend also has the potential to contribute as a “Twin Shield” against cyber-attacks. Data or Digitization is a common element among both tech trends that could make the integration possible and make it able to provide a virtual tamper-proof platform. In isolation, both the tech trends are disruptive and rapidly developing with hands-in-hand in FinTechs. However, in amalgamation, Fintech AI & blockchain can be astonishingly innovative and articulated with anticipations. The union is still a considerably undiscovered domain. Nevertheless, the blend of two tech trends is rare, but the combination will create a tremendous variance if placed unitedly on the identical board. Therefore, the interplay amidst the two tech trends will be the future of FinTech and, its progress would be anyone’s opinion. The only thing which is permanent in this world to survive is “Change”. Similarly, the FinTech improvisations are happening so fast so far and, it’s just the start to scratch the surface for identifying the future possibilities. However, it is no extravagance to assume that FinTech in hand with the assistance of AI & Blockchain is revolutionizing our endurance by creating things digitalized that don’t require any kind of substantial humanistic interplay. Moreover, it brings the new approach of RegTech i.e. technical notion in the realm of regulatory compliances and data protection. The ABCD of Technologies – Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Cloud Computing, Data Science, and numerous other techs are on the cutting edge and, business professionals are expected to solicit opportunities in their FinTech business model to find themselves in the “Win-Win” situation in the highly “Customer-Centric” world. No ambiguity that – Fintech AI & blockchain is empowering financial organizations like nevermore since 2008. Nowadays, these are adopted to make the process more explicit and immediate. The world is going on with the “Digitized Data”, and to drill out insights, we need AI & Blockchain. We all are aware of an old saying that – “Data is the New Oil”.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/solution-for-contact-centre-problems/", "title": "Solution for Contact Centre Problems | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "Dealing with a customer contact centre can be horror and tedious task anytime. Using the IVR and telephonic Menus can be so frustrating. Calling the customer care executive and resolving the problem can be an irritant. It can kill Brand reputation. The opportunity cost is quite high wasting our waiting time and energy to raise a ticket and follow up. This can be even more painful if you have multiple products and multiple contact centers to reach out to your problems. (Assume you have bought a TV and a mobile phone etc.., together.) Imagine how would it be login to an application and directly explain the customer service executive the problem without any kind of verification(or minimal verification) and long haul on the phone…What a relatively pleasurable experience it would be…Yes, this is possible through chat, phone, and all other mediums if you are on this particular SOVRIN block-chain network and using the HearRo solution built by Blackcoffer. You may just have to scan the BAR code or QR code of the product and connect with the customer care using the HearRO solution. To verify the product, the QR code is verified and to verify the customer SOVRIN identity is used. Both of them are minimal and one-time effort. Options to chat, audio, video call with support agents, with AI and automation and many more are possible. The customer need not communicate the same problem and information to the support agents more than once. Once it is said, it is recorded and relayed to the next level in case of an escalation. This can be implemented by a Seamless customer support software either through a web application or mobile app using AI and BlockChain technology. Blackcoffer has built this solution for HearRO. To have access to this network, one should enroll with SOVRIN, a digital (block-chain) network with minimal paperwork. There will be a one-time registration with identity papers from a government body like a post office. To implement this solution, HearRo depends upon TWILIO-flex which provides such a seamlessly integrated platform for contact centers. But unfortunately, there is no API and the documentation is quite poor. Hence, the need for building a new API, application to connect HearRO with TWILIO. The only challenge is the absence of a working API. Information related to Blockchain and communication to third party apps is very poorly documented, and nearly incomplete in providing solutions to integrate. If we overcome the challenges, the benefits are many. One can get connected with several customer platforms like Audio/Video Call and Messaging, chat with AI-enabled solutions. HearRo partnered with Blackcoffer to develop this integration, the API and the solution to React Javascript. This API is a total replacement for the poor documentation done from TWILIO’s end. Additionally, Testing, Automation, improved scalability are the main value-adds provided by Blackcoffer for multiple partners and customers. Using the SOVRIN network, both customers and contact center agents can use digital identity to login instead of logging in separately in separate applications.   We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/get-answers-from-structural-equation-modeling/", "title": "Get Answers from Structural Equation Modeling | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a series of statistical methods that allow complex relationships between one or more independent variables and one or more dependent variables.  Though there are many ways to describe SEM, it is most commonly thought of as a hybrid between some form of analysis of variance (ANOVA)/regression and some form of factor analysis.  In general, it can be remarked that SEM allows one to perform some type of multilevel regression/ANOVA on factors.  You should therefore be quite familiar with univariate and multivariate regression/ANOVA as well as the basics of factor analysis to implement SEM for your data. Some preliminary terminology will also be useful.  The following definitions regarding the types of variables that occur in SEM allow for a more clear explanation of the procedure: 6. For the purposes of SEM, specifically,   refers to a situation that includes three or more variables, such that there is a causal process between all three variables. Note that this is distinct from moderation.  In the previous example in (e), we can say there are three separate things in the model that cause a change in psychological adjustment:  stress, social support, and the combined effect of stress and social support that is not accounted for by each individual variable.  Mediation describes a much different relationship that is generally more complex.  In a mediation relationship, there is a   between an independent variable and a dependent variable.  There are also   between an independent variable and a mediator variable, and between a mediator variable and a dependent variable.  The example in (e) above can be re-specified into a mediating process, as shown in Figure 2 below.  The main difference from the moderation model is that we now allow for causal relationships between stress and social support and social support and psychological adjustment to be expressed.  Imagine that social support was not included in the model – we just wanted to see the direct effect of stress and psychological adjustment.  We would get a measure of the direct effect by using regression or ANOVA.  When we include social support as a mediator, that direct effect will change as a result of decomposing the causal process into indirect effects of stress on social support and social support on psychological adjustment.  The degree to which the direct effect changes as a result of including the mediating variable of social support is referred to as the  .  Testing for mediation involves running a series of regression analyses for all of the causal pathways and some method of estimating a change indirect effect.  This technique is actually involved in structural equation models that include mediator variables and will be discussed in the next section of this document. In many respects, moderation and mediational models are the foundation of structural equation modeling.  In fact, they can be considered as simple structural equation models themselves. Therefore, it is very important to understand how to analyze such models to understand more complex structural equation models that include latent variables.  Generally, a mediation model like the one above can be implemented by doing a series of separate regressions.  As described in later sections of this document, the effects in a moderation model can be numerically described by using  , which are identical or similar to regression coefficients, depending on the specific choice of analysis you are performing.  and   are the building blocks of how your data will be represented when doing any programming or model specification within a software program that implements structural equation modeling. You should know how to obtain a correlation matrix or covariance matrix using PROC CORR in SAS, or use other menu tools from a statistical package of your choice, to specify that a correlation or covariance matrix be calculated.  The covariance matrix in practice serves as your dataset to be analyzed.  In the context of SEM, covariances and correlations between variables are essential because they allow you to include a relationship between two variables that is not necessarily causal.  In practice, most structural equation models contain both causal and non-causal relationships.  Obtaining covariance estimates between variables allows one to better estimate direct and indirect effects with other variables, particularly in complex models with many parameters to be estimated. 8. A   is a part of the entire structural equation model diagram that you will complete for every model you propose. It is used to relate all of the variables (both latent and manifest) you will need to account for in the model.   There are a few important rules to follow when creating a structural model and they will be discussed in the second section of this document. 9. A  is a part of the entire structural equation model diagram that you will complete for every model you propose. It is essential if you have latent variables in your model.  This part of the diagram which is analogous to factor analysis:  You need to include all individual items, variables, or observations that “load” onto the latent variable, their relationships, variances, and errors.  There are a few important rules to follow when creating the measurement model and they will be discussed in the second section of this document. 10. Together, the structural model and the measurement model form the entire  . This model includes everything that has been measured, observed, or otherwise manipulated in the set of variables examined. 11. A  structural equation model is a model in which causation is directed in one single direction. A   structural equation model has causation which flows in both directions at some parts of the model. SEM can conceptually be used to answer any research question involving the indirect or direct observation of one or more independent variables or one or more dependent variables.  However, the primary goal of SEM is to determine and validify a proposed causal process and/or model.  Therefore, SEM is a confirmatory technique.  Like any other test or model, we have a sample and want to say something about the population that comprises the sample.  We have a covariance matrix to serve as our dataset, which is based on the sample of collected measurements.  The empirical question of SEM is therefore whether the proposed model produces a population covariance matrix that is consistent with the sample covariance matrix.  Because one must specify  a model that will undergo validation testing, there are many questions SEM can answer. SEM can tell you how if your model is adequate or not.  Parameters are estimated and compared with the sample covariance matrix.  The goodness of fit statistics can be calculated that will tell you whether your model is appropriate or needs further revision.  SEM can also be used to compare multiple theories that are specified  . SEM can tell you the amount of variance in the dependent variables (DVs) – both manifest and latent DVs – is accounted for by the IVs.  It can also tell you the reliability of each measured variable.  And, as previously mentioned, SEM allows you to examine mediation and moderation, which can include indirect effects. SEM can also tell you about group differences.  You can fit separate structural equation models for different groups and compare results.  In addition, you can include both random and fixed effects in your models and thus include hierarchical modeling techniques in your analyses. Because SEM is a confirmatory technique, you must plan accordingly.  You must specify a full model   and test that model based on the sample and variables included in your measurements.  You must know the number of parameters you need to estimate – including covariances, path coefficients, and variances.  You must know all relationships you want to specify in the model.  Then, and only then, can you begin your analyses? Because SEM has the ability to model complex relationships between multivariate data, the sample size is an important (but unfortunately underemphasized) issue.  Two popular assumptions are that you need more than 200 observations, or at least 50 more than 8 times the number of variables in the model.  Larger sample size is always desired for SEM. Like other multivariate statistical methodologies, most of the estimation techniques used in SEM require multivariate normality.  Your data need to be examined for univariate and multivariate outliers.  Transformations on the variables can be made.  However, there are some estimation methods that do not require normality. SEM techniques only look at first-order (linear) relationships between variables.  Linear relationships can be explored by creating bivariate scatterplots for all of your variables.  Power transformations can be made if a relationship between two variables seems quadratic. Multicollinearity among the IVs for manifest variables can be an issue.  Most programs will inspect the determinant of a section of your covariance matrix or the whole covariance matrix.  A very small determinant may be indicative of extreme multicollinearity. The residuals of the covariances (not residual scores) need to be small and centered about zero.  Some goodness of fit tests (like the Lagrange Multiplier test) remains robust against highly deviated residuals or non-normal residuals. Assuming you have checked for model assumptions, dealt with missing data, and imported your data into a software package, you should obtain a covariance matrix on your dataset.  In SAS, you can run PROC CORR and create an output file that has the covariance matrix.  Alternatively, you can manually type in the covariance matrix or import it from a spreadsheet.  You must specify in the data declaration that the set is a covariance matrix, so, in SAS for example, your code would appear as  ; effort must be made to ensure the decimals of the entries are aligned.  Other programs like EQS or LISREL can handle full datasets and will automatically compute covariance matrices for you. Often, the most difficult part of SEM is correctly  your model.  You must know exactly the number of latent and manifest variables you are including in your model, as well as the number of variances and covariances to be calculated, as well as the number of parameters you are estimating.  This section details the rules and conventions that are used when specifying a model.  At this time it does not cover a complete set of rules for each popular software programs that are available (EQS, LISREL, AMOS, and PROC CALIS in SAS).  In general, though, the conventions that follow are generally compatible with the existing software programs. The most important part of SEM analysis is the causal model you are required to draw before attempting an analysis.  The following basic, general rules are used when drawing a model: .  Latent variables/factors are represented with circles and measured/manifest variables are represented with squares. .  Lines with an arrow in one direction show a hypothesized direct relationship between the two variables.  It should originate at the causal variable and point to the variable that is caused.  The absence of a line indicates there is no causal relationship between the variables. Lines with an arrow in both directions should be curved and this demonstrates a bi-directional relationship (i.e., a covariance). Covariance arrows should only be allowed for exogenous variables   For every endogenous variable, a residual term should be added to the model.  Generally, a residual term is a circle with the letter E written in it, which stands for error.     For latent variables that are also endogenous, a residual term is not called error in the lingo of SEM.  It is called a disturbance, and therefore the “error term” here would be a circle with a D written in it, standing for the disturbance.

Big data is defined by the variety, volume, speed, and analytics involve in processing cost-effectively to be able to draw conclusions for their useful application. From transforming development initiatives to improving transparency, Big Data analytics can have a major impact on the way governments work. Big data and government agencies are teaming up to help agencies run more efficiently and better serve constituents at all levels. Due to recent technological advancements, government agencies are now leveraging big data insights in a variety of innovative ways. With increased requirements of data at the higher managerial level or declining budgets, they are looking to do more with less— a path of digital transformation can help them get there. At the same time, government agencies are modernizing their data warehouses by using advanced technological tools, optimizing their enterprise resource planning solutions, and commoditizing their storage so as to reduce red-tapism and enhance more transparency in the system. Big data brings new opportunities as well as new risks when it comes to integrity and confidentiality of data. Thus, good data governance is pivotal for organizations in the big data world these days. Further, companies have to adopt practical steps to manage them effectively. Huge data and associated analytics are advantageous in numerous areas, such as, The potential of big data can be easily used by government agencies by employing sufficient method through the collection, transformation, and processing of information getting from various sources. Big data provides a big opportunity for government agencies to process it accurately which helps to make a proper decision, identifying corruption, criminal and challenges and threats, and making a future decision. It is not only useful for public sector organizations like government actors, cities, and citizens but also health care and social media. Since the government has a major responsibility to generate and managing knowledge. Government is a center of both creating and managing knowledge. So, the government can manage it by analyzing big data through analysis. One of the most critical aspects of data analytics is its effect on how decisions are made and who makes such crucial decisions. When data is costly to obtain, scarce, or unavailable in digital form, it makes sense to allow people with experience to make decisions based on relationships and patterns they have observed from data. Leaders state their opinions on what the future brings, what will happen, how well something would work, and so on as per their intuition and plans accordingly. \nIn the era of growing usages of big data, managers and leaders in private companies and the government should be data-driven. They must avoid using hit and trial basis of work and rather do what the data states. This needs a change in mindset from using the traditional way of doing the work manually and effective training is needed to make decisions based on data-driven. Though businesses have tried hard to adopt data and analytics in different forms efficiently to boost business efficiency and personalize offerings, governments have been laggards. The possible benefits that data analytics could bring to the government could vary from transforming the programs of the government like using Big Data and Analytics where data is more complex for human interface to interpret and empowering citizens thereby to boost transparency and to enable participation of all stakeholders. Governments differ from businesses when it comes to goals, mission, and decision making. Though decision-makers in businesses are limited there is a diverse set in government. The government has tremendous data in legacy databases collected from various sources and forms that must be curated and migrated for new-age analytic tools. Further, data collection is a paramount task for the government since data is received from numerous online and offline channels. Data sharing and retaining it between departments and across ministries is a challenge, provided the existing jurisdictional boundaries. Data analytics when properly managed could be a blessing for the government struggling to gain bigger insights about any particular projects or for the future course of action for an economy as a whole. However, it could also be a curse to the organizations and governments that are not prepared to handle the untold x-bytes of unstructured data pouring unceasingly into their coffers. This is the dilemma most companies wake up to every day, and thus they capture only a fraction of the value that data analytics brings. Realizing the essence of digital advancement, Big data could have a huge impact only when used on a massive scale, with safeguards by the government for the delivery of public services and goods.  Every government agency should adopt big data technology for reducing corruption, threat, and challenges and increasing efficiency, accountability, and transparency which will help to become themselves transparent, accountable, and hassle-free public agencies. \n     We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/marketing-drives-results-with-a-focus-on-problems/", "title": "Marketing Drives Results With A Focus On Problems | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "When\nthe British ruled India, many Indians\naccepted to work under their policy, and they did not try to rebel against the British for\ntheir presence in Indian lands; They recognized the benefits of British rule. What\nwas the factor that made Indians accept the\nBritish government? The perception about\nBritish-policies (about trading, pay-scale, and positioning in the military) had been\ndone through various marketing channels in such a way that it brainwashed people of the nation, and many were ready to accept the British. So the Marketing is like fire when smartly\nhandled; it can destroy your enemies, but when not it can burn you.   Marketing is to design and develop a pathway from product or service to the customer through a product, price, place and promotion strategies. Marketing depends on a variety of parameters that can be classified broadly, boiling down to vital three. These are ‘What type of customer are marketing team is focusing on (based on gender, age, location, customer-class) (W1)’, ‘What are Product Specification or Applications you need to bring in front of customer (W2)’, ‘What is your Product Promotion flow path (W3)’, ‘How much time it takes to convey product information to customer (H1)’. These criteria are what I call ‘3W1H’ forms. These basics need to be taken care of while developing a marketing strategy for the upcoming product. However, are they enough? No. There is one more parameter called the Feedback mechanism (FM). Generally, machines use the feedback mechanism to check output generated is as per input is given or not and if it is not, the input is corrected to get the required output. When it comes to human beings, he/she is surrounded by multiple products daily through social media, TV advertising and so forth. Slight uncertainties on either side in observation can make a positive or negative impact on the product on the consumer’s mind. In the feedback mechanism, the marketing team needs to answer only one question “What kind of product image built in the customer mind through promotional activities?” If the product image not built as per expectation, then management has to review and work on 3W1H, as discussed earlier. So let’s elaborate how 3W1H approach works along with feedback mechanism.  After deciding the customer range, you can work on other\nactivities. Since the customer is\nconscious about purchasing the product and\nwhen the product promoted, the first thing the customer will check is its\nusefulness, and if his/her answer is ‘Yes,’\nthen the customer will start comparing with similar alternative products in the\nmarket. Therefore, one should present the\nproduct along with some unique thought\nand express the product in such a way that its image imprinted into the consumer\nmind. For example, the polio campaign in\nIndia. The government had taken the initiative to make India polio-free by\nspreading awareness through all types of social communication mediums, in which\nTelevision played a vital role. Legendary\ncinema actor ‘Amitabh Bachchan’ was selected as an ambassador for this campaign.\nInitially, the advertisement published in which Amitabh pleaded people for vaccinating\nthe children within a fixed schedule. The advertisement circulated throughout the nation, and\nno stone was kept unturned by the government\nto make this campaign successful. However,\nmuch to the surprise, advertising failed miserably to attract a deprived community in polio booth. This promotion failure was because of\nnon-consideration of the customer (W1)\nand how advertise impacted its application on the customer (W2)? So after analysing failure, experts recommended changes\nin their marketing campaign like, to focus on major customer (Here mainly\nvillage woman who generally spend their time in home by watching TV), type of\nimpact on people (People who watched TV during that era, had an image of\nAmitabh as ‘Angry young man’). So the campaign\nimproved their advertising by bringing out the same angry Amitabh instead of\nhis soft-image, which used in the earlier campaign. So in a very next polio\ncampaign number of people in the polio booth suddenly increased and when\nfeedback is taken from people about such a sudden change, they replied that we\ndon’t want to watch ‘Amitabh sir’ getting angry because of us. In\nW3, organisation must focus on what kind of channel use to attract the customer. Currently,\nthere are a lot of platforms available by\nwhich you can market your product. The main\nagenda you should keep in mind is that how effectively you can engage the customer\nthrough marketing, at very first, if you make an\nimpact on customer then only, he can show interest in your product. For\nexample, changes in launching trailers of\nthe upcoming films. Till 20 \ncentury Television and newspaper were crucial\nfactors, but now along with television, marketing team take help of internet\nresources like Youtube, Facebook,\nintroducing an article on the pre-trailer phenomenon. Increasing the range of promotional devices, broadcast formats and publishing platforms provide a broad range to promote the film and choosing right platform may lead to a massive hit in the box-office.     For\nthe last factor (H1) time, the obvious question that comes to mind is that ‘Is time for advertising matters?’, While\nwatching the TV when an advertisement appears,\nmany times we change the channel instead of\nwatching the whole ad or ignore it altogether. You do have an option of ‘Skip ad’ when you watch anything online, so one must decide how much time is required\nto deliver product information during its\npromotion? Delivering product information\nin less time, may create the possibility that the customer will watch it so it\ncan result in attracting more customers. So, the content will be the\nking in the marketing. However, as one\nmust have guessed it, this will not work all the time. Other factors like the cost of the product,\napplication range, type of customer can also affect\nthe H1. For example, the customer would be\nmore conscious while watching higher-priced\nproduct broadcast compare to the lower-priced one. So it would take more time\nfor the marketing team to convince the\ncustomer to buy the expensive good than the lower-priced one. After\nimplementing a marketing strategy as per 3W1H, we need to work on a feedback mechanism in which organization has to collect information about\nproduct image generated in customer’s minds through dealers and using feedback-form. Not using the feedback mechanism may lead to failure in achieving\n‘product sales target’ and can make the situation even worse. Take the example of ‘ ,’ which was mind-blowing one-of-a-kind projects in Indian\nautomobile industry. From the first phase of a marketing\ncampaign, TATA Nano was on so much\ncontinuous limelight that this project was pleased by former American president\nBarack Obama. \nThe curiosity about the product\nwas so high that the sale of then-leading\ncar model Maruti-800 was dropped by 20% immediately after unveiling the Nano. \nHowever, while marketing the product, an organization built “Affordable, Garibo Ki Car” image in customer’s mind,\nwhich made customers conscious about what will be their status-quo in society\nafter buying Nano? Thus, they started giving preference to two-wheelers over Nano. During the same time, some instances of Nanos catching fire came\ninto focus, which worsened the situation.\nThis case even exacerbates when the team\ndid not work on the feedback mechanism\nand hence, was not able to change customer\nperception about Nano. Later, when Nano fire problem was technically sorted out\nbut even then, the marketing team did not\nmake any impactful effort to market the improved safety of the car. Therefore, customer’s negative perception\nremained stuck and the organization did\nnot even come close to achieving selling\nfigures of Nano. If the organization had used\nfeedback mechanism, it would have been an entirely different story.  So\n3W1H can be an essential factor while\ndeveloping a marketing strategy for the\nproduct along with a reversible FM\nmethod. This method can help us to\nmonitor Product marketing throughout the phases and can help the marketing team to\nchange strategy whenever it goes into the wrong\npath. \n   https://www.businesstoday.in/obamas-india-visit/nano-catches-worlds-most-powerful-mans-eyes/story/10144.html   https://www.businesstoday.in/obamas-india-visit/nano-catches-worlds-most-powerful-mans-eyes/story/10144.html We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/ai-healthcare-revolution-ml-technology-algorithm-google-analytics-industrialrevolution/", "title": "How AI will impact the future of work? | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "AI experts believe it’s going to be one of the main   of the fourth  and that it has the potential to not just transform the tech sectors and going to open a new chapter of the society of the world that people try to understand themselves better rather than the outside world with AI because people who are naysayer and kind of try to drum up these doomsday scenarios are pretty irresponsible. After all, In the next, five to ten years AI is going to deliver so many improvements and the quality of our lives it is a  , a golden age of   and   that was the realm of science fiction for the last several decades. AI is probably the most important thing humanities that have ever worked which is more profound than any work with technology, as it is important to harness the benefits and while minimizing the downside is focusing on autonomous systems like self-driving cars seen as the mother of all AI projects and has made applications like   viable for the first time, three things happen at the same time number one data collection and data processing became easier because of better technologies right um you need data to fuel AI training and that’s been one of the big drivers the second thing that has happened is that   has become faster that’s like the engine so no matter how much fuel you have if you don’t have that engine and processing the data on a timeframe that’s reasonable was just not possible and the third thing that’s happened is that   have been developed which has made AI much more powerful so #technology has been changing and developing at a pace that’s much faster than ever before and we have not been used to this rapid pace of change which means that we have not been used to thinking about how it’s going to impact our immediate future. The most important factor responsible for the growth of AI is   and its AI what Google’s done is given all of us the power to get the relevant information we want at our fingertips this has created a shift in how things are bought but it didn’t happen overnight this started in 2004 but the major change only happens to start 2012 onwards Google’s taken away about 65% of sales people’s jobs that were primarily order takers and the ones that are remaining are likely to be gone over the next decade. In present several AI projects are helping in diagnosing diseases better match up drugs with people depending on what they’re sick they can get treated better so it’s going to help a whole lot of people get treated and get better #healthcare than would have had access to it before if you look at self-driving cars they’re going to be safer than people driving cars and the value that machine learning is providing is actually happening beneath the surface and it is things like improved search results improved product recommendations for customers improve forecasting for inventory management and literally hundreds of other things including speech-recognition or image-recognition that the performance levels are phenomenal  or drug discovery as these biological systems are very complicated because vaccines for TB and HIV developing that’s notably enabled by this rich data advanced in biology and machine learning and recent invention in which is an application we just launched for anybody with visual impairment ass it uses the latest cutting-edge computer vision technology to give anyone the ability to see, so anyone who has dyslexia can now use AI to be able to read better and with the  latest release of Windows 10 has this capability called IJ’s which enable the eye muscle that the gaze can help to type. Like the two sides of the coin, there are negative impacts of AI as well  Bill Gates Ellen Musk also tech giants in a way their views are pessimistic, to say the least, they warned against the potential of AI to replace humans in the workplace and Ella masks even went as far as to claim that AI is the biggest existential threat to mankind. because of the loss of a job, when you think about a job or a career choice if a majority of the tasks that comprise that career choice is likely to be these vulnerable tasks then that is a career at risk in the future so what are the tasks that AI will find? hard to do anything unpredictable anything that requires skills like creative thinking or empathy or interpersonal skills but it’s important to understand tomorrow whether Google is there or not, artificial intelligence is going to progress you know technology has just nature it’s that it’s going to evolve as  technology and in particular AI can, in fact, bring more empowerment more inclusiveness and at the same time it is important to be clear-eyed about displacement and unintended consequences like any other technology and work both skills so that people can find the jobs of the future create new jobs also the policy decisions that help people as they go through this change people already unhappy because of machine learning artificial intelligence as they think  if they’re not innovative enough or not creative enough your job will be taking away by a lot of machines AI for business going to affect the future of work specifically there are jobs that are at more risk of being taken over by AI and automation there is very wide dissonance on this, there are different reports that have been shared by  Oxford study that says 47% of US jobs are at risk of automation over the next few years meanwhile the general population and workers think differently a recent study conducted by college actually identifies that 97% of workers believe that most jobs will be automated but not their own this suggests that the general public needs to be educated on which jobs are  susceptible to this risk which are not and businesses need to be aware of the forthcoming skills gap of course not all jobs are equal the Oxford study that highlights this they examined 700 participants and found the generalist occupations that require creative knowledge or innovation are at least risk the same is true for occupations in education healthcare media and arts jobs on the flip side jobs like telemarketers junior lawyers accountants are at most risk in short there is a simple rule of thumb if your job is in some way predictable or routine the risk of automation is much higher if a job doesn’t require innovation or creativity then the return on investment for companies is higher on machines than real-time employees machines are faster can’t be distracted and can work 24/7 this is actually good for creative marketers because AI and automation can serve to augment their jobs rather than substituting them as impact of emerging technologies on the creative economy they stated that artificial intelligence is changing  creative content from beginning to end by 2030 AI will be able to write high school essays code in Python composed top 40s chart songs and make creative videos but all of these advancements also come with risks and costs take a look at this report by the global Commission on the future of work in the absence of effective transition policies many people will have to accept lower skilled and lower paying jobs high-skilled workers are taking less cognitively demanding jobs displacing less educated workers and this is already happening also technological dividends are being unevenly distributed among firms a very limited amount of companies tend to dominate when it comes to big data just think about Google and Facebook today they alone are responsible for 70% of the referral marketing traffic and  receive more than 50% of total global advertising budget so the question is in businesses workers and social institutions go into the same direction if companies and public policy leaders can understand the evolving landscape they can help the workforce anticipate the upcoming challenges technology and the demographic changes are leading to a smaller workforce compared to the previous generation and a workforce that has to pursue many careers during their time of work we need to provide workers with an environment where they can continuously upskill and grow governments will have to re-evaluate the educational system we will have to continuously learn and grow and companies will have to redesign their structure and their culture around technology just like during the Industrial Revolution we are heading into a new age and the great transformation that we’re about to see by 2022 it is estimated that 20 to 25 percent of the labor force will be displaced within 10 to 20 years however this is also an opportunity for people to get ahead for which different ways have to be find to attract and retain highly skilled workers and allow them the time to up skill themselves even during work hours and it is a  good way  to develop a learning community to benefit from each other and also to use technology to supplement goal tracking and  efforts instead of as a distraction in short what we are doing is  to bridge the dissonance and it is imperative to build a  map of how AI and automation will affect  industry and  company if this is an economic imperative how do people feel about committing itself to a lifelong approach to knowledge as  these risks are important but it is important to do things like from being upfront to have ethical charters like AI safety and to be very transparent and open and how we perceive progress there and figure out global frameworks by which we can engage just like Paris agreement and climate change by using  such forums bring people together as they engage on the hard questions and it will emerge answers and on the question of whether AI is a threat or not, artificial intelligence is not  a threat because there is a rare case where people need to be proactive in regulation instead of reactive because I think by the time we are reactive in AI regulation it’s too late right now we have machine learning algorithms that can solve an incredibly complex problem beyond any human intelligence  as they are mere machines that can be given enormous data set and they come up with brilliant correlations and insights but they’re not going threaten the human population anytime soon because fish intelligent isn’t terrible but human being a smart enough to learn that skills at least to have a complete toolbox to be prepared volatility of the future

As if a customer was interacting with a clerk in a retail store, conversational commerce makes it possible for users to engage with software to research, purchase, or get customer assistance with products and services across a wide range of industries. With Alexa, for example, users can ask any Alexa-enabled device to add an item to an Amazon shopping cart, set a purchasing reminder when a product is running low, or carry out a complete purchase without having to access a shopping cart. The result is a seamless conversational experience that enables consumers to carry out transactions as quickly as it takes to speak a sentence. Through AI tools like natural language processing, Alexa has led the retail industry in its rise towards conversational commerce. As if a customer was interacting with a clerk in a retail store, conversational commerce makes it possible for users to engage with software to research, purchase, or get customer assistance with products and services across a wide range of industries. With the advent of personalized products and on-call delivery, customers have come to expect a new standard experience: fast, easy, accurate, and personalized. Accomplishing this without sacrificing your workday can be a challenge, since the data processing required to meet these needs is immense. Luckily, virtual agents (VAs), powered by conversational AI, can utilize this information faster and more accurately than humans, finding insights and automating communication to deliver an enriched customer experience. If you invest based on these improvements, you’ll find that implementing these tools delivers a powerful competitive advantage. AI has helped in automobile, education, retail and commerce, finance and banking and healthcare. Voice AI has powered the wheels of conversational e-commerce, which has impacted the way the customer communicates with the brand in multiple industries. Brands generally build a campaign to emotionally connect with customers, for long-term growth. With Voice, brand campaigns need to be short and ones that can lead to immediate buying. Conversational e-commerce is still in its nascent stage and it is expected to grow manifold in the coming years. The future of shopping is going to Voice AI and marketers have to get on the bandwagon fast to increase their brand value and visibility. Targeting will have to be highly personalized for success. Despite its narrow focus, conversation AI is an extremely lucrative technology for enterprises, helping businesses more profitable. While an AI chatbot is the most popular form of conversational AI, there are still many other use cases across the enterprise.  While an exclusively chat- or voice-based shopping experience for all scenarios may never completely replace the in-person experience, conversational commerce will continue to grow as an added method of convenient and efficient communication. As users continue to become more accustomed to engaging with chatbots and voice-driven interfaces, expect more innovations in the space as brands continue to develop their unique conversation-based solutions.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/negative-effects-of-marketing-on-society/", "title": "Negative effects of marketing on society | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "Marketing is the management process of anticipating, identifying, and satisfying customers’ requirements. The various conventional marketing tools are advertising, branding, direct marketing, sales promotion, publicity, and public relations. Critics acknowledge that marketing has legitimate uses in as much as it connects goods and services to consumers who desire them. However, some aspects of marketing, especially promotion and advertisements, are subject to criticism. They argue that product promotion is an attempt by the goods and service providers to influence demand. Advertising has become such an inextricable part of our lives that one cannot imagine life without it. Although we hardly ever notice, advertisements leave an indelible mark on our minds, especially on vulnerable groups like children and adolescents. The commensuration of the two words raises eyebrows in marketing and society, as it is highly debatable. On the one hand, Society thrives on Companies’ marketing efforts, while another school of thought argues that marketing makes society more materialistic. Today, striking a balance between the two is the challenge marketers face. Ethical expectations are a vital part of the business environment. Society expects businesses to be honest and desires corporate executives, at all levels, to apply ethical principles- in other words, guidelines as to what is right and wrong, fair and unfair, and morally correct- when they make business decisions. For better or worse, marketing is everywhere, with the allure of new products, big promises, and hope for something new or different. As we turn on the television or scroll through social media feeds, we will find it hard to avoid someone trying to sell us something. While advertising and marketing share information and tell us what is new, it does so to persuade rather than educate, so their influence can sometimes be more harmful than positive. The debate about the positives and negatives of advertising is a bit like the infamous chicken or egg question. Some people claim that marketing causes adverse effects, while others argue that it merely reflects what is already happening in the culture. For all the positive potential of marketing, the reality is that it frequently influences society in negative ways. One negative aspect of marketing is its potential to feed into unrealistic expectations, breed discontentment, and influence our thought processes in ways beyond our control. Materialism, workaholism, unhealthy lifestyle habits, alcoholism, politics, and unrealistic views negatively shape our culture and impact the most vulnerable. According to research, marketing has become increasingly hostile in the modern television era. Consumers are often disturbed by advertisements & marketing, and negative campaign ads tend to fuel a vicious cycle where both sides fling ads back and forth in a futile, narcissistic, tantrum-like attempt to make their opponents look worse and worse while making themselves look better. Marketing aims to present a product in the best light possible. There is some leeway in the creative process. The problem arises when dramatization crosses the line into falsely representing a product. Hefty fines can result from false advertising when levied by the authorities. Marketing and advertising are ingrained in the modern culture, from children’s programs on Saturday mornings to talk shows and prime-time TV. Advertising even invades movies through product placement. Marketing influences how people feel about themselves and often turns out negative. Widespread concern exists about the potential effects of media portrayals of drinking, alcohol product placements, and alcohol advertising on alcohol consumption and problems among young people. Television, radio, film, and popular music are often identified as potential sources through which young people learn about alcohol and as possible influences on young people’s drinking and drinking problems. Even though campaign advertising has been a part of politics, scholars are still conflicted over the effects of different advertising strategies. As a result, the literature on political advertising is vast and multifaceted. Conventional wisdom holds that political advertising, in general, is harmful to democracy. Further, the adverse effects of advertising on teenagers include increased cigarette and alcohol use, obesity, poor nutrition, and eating disorders, according to Pediatrics, the official journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Advertisers are traditionally using techniques to which children and adolescents are more susceptible, such as product placement in TV shows and tie-ins between movies and fast-food restaurants, to mention a few. It’s all kid’s play anyway, with today’s youngsters having profound influence over purchases in all product categories. Many marketing evils lure people into buying even when not required. However, the picture of the relationship between marketing and society is contested. Marketing has often been criticized for encouraging excessive consumption, self-indulgent lifestyle, and producing a consumer culture where products and services are the core of social identity at the expense of other ‘traditional’ values. Just as in an underdeveloped economy, marketing can be an avenue for publicity of indigenous products and services, thereby generating income; similarly, in developing and developed economies, where competition for the share of the customer’s pocket is high, marketing can lead to attitudinal and lifestyle changes and problems. Free collectible coupons or tattoos inside chips packets, and other such advertising gimmicks and tactics do not add any value to the product being offered but only lure consumers into buying a product they otherwise may not have purchased- leading to another group of people who entice these students to enroll for a weight reduction program! Sex is used in commercials to sell everything from beer to shampoo to cars. New research shows that teenagers’ exposure to sexual content in the media may be responsible for the earlier onset of sexual intercourse or other sexual activities leading to an increased number of HIV-positive cases. Alcohol producers spend $ 5.7 billion/per year on advertising and promotions. Research has found that adolescent drinkers are more likely to have been exposed to alcohol advertising. Studies confirm a direct link between junk food advertisements and obesity among adolescents. As we move ahead with technology and change the marketing strategy with the growing consumerism, it is vital to be cautious. Our cautiousness can only decide what happens in the future regarding marketing.

The whole world is running on two phenomena, either #technology or marketing. In a simple sense, earlier if we had to buy something our choice was clear with respect to the product, its price, brand, even shops from where to purchase, and more such factors. There were not many alternates and substitutes available in the market for anything. But now the scenario has changed and we could find ample alternates and substitutes available in the market and not only that, even we have alternatives to markets as well. Now we even have a choice among the mode of the market to choose from, i.e. either physical market or virtual market. Simultaneously the competition between the businesses has also risen. So a question arises, in such a competitive and dynamic environment how do businesses sustain themselves?  The only solution to this question is ADVERTISEMENT / MARKETING. Marketing plays a very important role in the #success and failure of any company. Marketing philosophy is implemented to attract new and existing customers towards their product/service or company. The very common tool used for marketing is advertising. The basic idea behind advertising is to give customers knowledgeable about the product or service in a very interesting and attractive way. Any company should opt for the advertisement model very judiciously. The advertisement tells customers which product they should buy and which to leave. Advertisement affects businesses in a very crucial way as they decide whether a product is ready to play in long run or not. Most of the products are chosen by the customers because of the advertisement only. If businesses don’t advertise then no one will buy their products. Advertisements are the main reason behind the revenues of a company. There are many ways to do advertise through electronic mediums such as televisions, radio, social media, etc., and paper mediums such as newspapers. Wrong advertisements can be harmful to businesses as they provide information in the wrong manner. Instead of being the needs of people, it becomes unnecessary for the people. This could result in a big loss for the company and may also hamper the image of the company. For example, TATA introduced the Nano car in India to have low price car but its marketing went wrong in the eyes of the public and it got failed. So advertising/marketing affects a business in both positive and negative ways.

The below Algorithm is designed for use on Financial Texts. It consists of steps: The Stop Words Lists (found  ) are used to clean the text so that Sentiment Analysis can be performed by excluding the words found in Stop Words List. The Master Dictionary (found  ) is used for creating a dictionary of Positive and Negative words. We add only those words in the dictionary if they are not found in the Stop Words Lists. We convert the text\ninto a list of tokens using the nltk tokenize module and use these tokens to\ncalculate the 4 variables described below: This is determined\nby grouping the Polarity score values in the following groups. Analysis of Readability is calculated using the Gunning Fox index formula\ndescribed below. The formula for calculating is: Complex words are words in the text that contain more than two syllables. We count the total   words present in the text by  We count the number of Syllables in each word of the text by counting the\nvowels present in each word. We also handle some exceptions like words ending\nwith “es”,”ed” by not counting them as a syllable. To calculate Personal Pronouns mentioned in the text, we use regex to\nfind the counts of the words – “I,” “we,” “my,” “ours,” and “us”. Special care\nis taken so that the country name US is not included in the list. Passive Words are the Auxiliary verbs followed by a word ending in “ed”\nor one of 200 irregular verbs present in the Past form column in this  . Auxiliary verbs are – auxiliary verb variants of “to be” including: “to\nbe”, “to have”, “will be”, “has been”, “have been”, “had been”, “will have\nbeen”, “being”, “am”, “are”, “is”, “was”, and “were”. Average Word Length is calculated by the formula: Sum of the total number of characters in each word/Total number of words Calculated by a Software package called Style Writer designed to identify English attributes and calculate the score. Measure of words pertaining to uncertainty in a\nsentence. It is calculated by assigning the value of +1\nfor each word if found in the Uncertainty Keyword Dictionary. This measure is calculated by measuring the statements which predict or project something in future events or possibilities and can be calculated by counting such statements. Calculating words that are related to risk\nfactors and assigning the value of +1 for every word found in the dictionary\nand adding up the values. Using a Named Entity Recognition (NER) approach to find names of persons, places, and organizations. Document, Paragraphs i.e News Articles in this case Names of places, people, dates, currency amounts, locations in the article. Documents, Articles, i.e., New Articles in this case. Set of words that are most likely to describe the topic within the document or the article. LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) The LDA model words as W – Each word in a topic Z – Topic N – Single document M – Collection of Documents α – per-document-topic distributions β – per-topic word distribution The LDA algorithm works on BOW or the bag of words approach that doesn’t not has any syntax to its sentences but still can be used to tell the topic of the words. It assumes that every topic Z is made up of a collection of words W with each word being assigned a probability that it belongs to a specific topic Z and each document N is made up of several topics Z with varied percent of several topics covered in each document. The process is done for all the documents taking out probabilities for each word belonging to some topic we come up with a final model of the words and their relation to the topics covered in the documents. On applying this model to the corpus of words in a document we have, we get the topics that are covered in the document i.e. the words associated with it. Topic Modelling is a useful method that enhances a researcher’s ability to interpret large amount of text documents for information. It is frequently used as a text-mining tool for discovery of hidden structure in a text body. The topic modelling is used to identify the hidden topic and the strongly related words that are associated with any documents. The Topic modelling along with Sentiment analysis is a very powerful measure that can be used to explore and summarize any article that has been covered in the news. The deep learning model is applied to the news data to get more details insights about the data. In this deep learning model, we prepared a set of all possible keywords that are related to the start-up, entrepreneur environment, and the model is prepared to check for the occurrence of each keyword in the throughout the document of news. Any keywords from the prepared set found in the text document we add a weight of +1 to that keyword and after iterating through all the keywords add up all the weights to find the total contribution of that keyword to the news text. Document or set of news text documents. The weight and contribution of each keywords related to the research topics.

I am referring to ways to map users into predefined   and then modify the content of the site based on what that   is interested in. Recently, I grew interested in graph databases – in particular, Neo4J Graph Database – and since it’s quite simple to create a graph that maps the structure of a website (i.e. the website sitemap), I began to think that there might be a way to employ the power of graph DBs to: This morning, while I was having breakfast, I started brainstorming possible ways to use Neo4J   to track users.

This is my interpretation of his suggestion: At this point, we realized that the 140 characters limit imposed by Twitter would get in the way of an interesting discussion and we decided to turn this brainstorming session into a blog post to give everyone a chance to participate.

India, the world’s third-largest economy after America with China already surpassing the USA and India surpassing Japan to become a larger #economy is now behind China in terms of urbanization with 675 million people living in urbanized cities as compared to China which has 1bn people living in urbanized cities. But what is the cost of urbanization?  ? Is it positive or negative? Has it eased our leaving or are we becoming more  ?  has always been the driving force for any change in society be it from the     in the 18th century to the advancement of the Internet. The world has changed massively and is continuously changing with cities   into smart ones with more #opportunities and #betterment of  . Cities change the future and they are the #engines of economic growth and modernization. With half of the world now living in #urban cities. It is this urbanization that is changing the trajectory of   miraculously. The present cities which are in the top 10 with the highest #GDP share might not be there in the list of 2035. A report by Oxford Economics claims that most of the cities will be from Asia with New York and London still being the leader as it has deep roots in  and   institutes. Likewise, Population and  can become major assets to a country’s growth. India’s burgeoning working-age demographics will present a #unique advantage for themselves and the country is projected to contain several of the fastest-growing cities in the coming years. If we talk about the annual GDP growth rate of the cities which are likely to top the charts, it is also a surprise for the West. Not a single city is from the West anymore but all are from the Asian block, mainly dominated by India and China, and some cities from Southeast Asia. Bangalore with a massive GDP growth rate of 8.5 percent leads the pack followed by Dhaka, Mumbai, and Delhi. Bangalore has a colossal amount of talent pool and the startup culture makes it unique on its own. It is safe to say the next Silicon Valley of Asia and the world is Bangalore itself. The amount of startups it generates now is huge. It has the potential to be one of the most urbanized cities in the world. The annual average GDP growth of the entire world, which will be around 2.5 percent, is very minimal for these cities which will surpass it by a fair amount. Surely countries will grow as well as cities will be modernized to cater to the needs of society. Migration from rural to urban has been a key reason for the expansion of urban cities. But if we can maintain a balance between both the environment and sustainable growth, the future would be better for us as well as our future generations. Climate change is real and it’s affecting us. The impacts of climate change will lead to a worsening of environmental conditions in vast regions in the form of extended heat episodes, more erratic rainfall, drought, and flooding. As we are seeing in Europe, China, and Pakistan. Heatwaves in the entire continent of Europe have caused problems in society, likewise, China is experiencing severe heat waves in the country causing rivers to dry up due to which hydroelectricity cannot be generated. Pakistan witnessed an unprecedented amount of floods in the region. Out of 160 districts,110 districts are underwater and a loss of almost 10bn dollars.  These impacts particularly affect rural agrarian and pastoralist communities of society which heavily depend on the environment. With livelihoods being increasingly disrupted by climate change across the globe, climate-driven migration will likely increase. According to the World Bank Groundswell report, Sub-Saharan, and Southeast Asia could see more than 130 million people move within their countries’ making it a massive amount of migration if no urgent global and national climate actions are taken right now.(Rigaud et al., 2018) Urbanization also affects the broader prospects of regional environments. Regions downwind from large industrial complexes also see huge increases in the amount of air pollution, precipitation, and the number of days with thunderstorms. Urban areas generate more rain, but they reduce the infiltration of water and thus lower the water tables. Energy consumption for electricity, transportation, cooking, and heating is much higher in urban areas than in rural villages. For example, urban populations nowadays have more cars than rural populations. Almost all of the cars in the world in the 1930s were in the country of the United States. Today we have a car for every two people in that country. China, the United States, and India are the top three countries that contribute to the global greenhouse emitter. If that becomes the norm, in 2050 there would be almost 5.3 billion cars in the world, all using the energy of cars and destroying the environment with their global emission. A large share of migrants will be moving to cities. In many countries, including the G20 ones, urbanization processes are driven by rural-urban migration in response to rapid changes in production, especially manufacturing. India is now trying to catch up with manufacturing after becoming successful in the service sector as it sees an opportunity in front of them. With China 2035 moving towards a more AI-based service sector, it will be the young population of India that will cater to the needs of the world.  Better labor market prospects in urban areas pull in young people, while lack of social and economic opportunities as well as environmental drivers of the society push people out of their rural origins to search for a better and higher standard of living in the urban centers. As a consequence, G20 countries like China, India, and South Africa have seen major urban growth in the past decades. People who live in urban areas have very different consumption patterns than the residents of rural areas. For example, urban populations consume much more amounts of food, energy, and durable goods than rural populations. In China during the 1970s, the urban populations also consumed more than twice as much pork as the rural populations who were raising pigs. With economic development, people now have declined their consumption as the rural populations of the countries ate better diets. The health implications of environmental problems include respiratory infections and other infectious and parasitic diseases. Capital costs for building improved environmental infrastructure are also costly for example, investments in a cleaner public transportation system such as a subway — and for building more hospitals and clinics are higher in cities than people in rural areas, where wages exceed those paid in rural areas and also the cost to avail the services are much higher in urban cities than in rural areas. Infrastructure does play an important role in the process of urbanization. India, which is now aiming toward a 5 trillion economy, is building up a huge infrastructure to support the economy. Infrastructure like roads, bridges, and railway networks are the veins of an economy. Just like China created a pool of massive infrastructures to support the economy  Being a developing country India has to prioritize sectors for their both inclusive as well as exclusive growth and as India moves towards a manufacturing hub, India needs to move towards better network and fast-paced network to support the movement of logistics  Often it is said- roads are the true mirror of the economy as India is moving from highways to expressways it needs to sustain these changes so that shortly you have infrastructures ready to move ahead in leaps and bounds. Therefore, to enable macroeconomic stabilization through the expansion of revenue expenditure, ring-fencing of capital expenditure levels as a share of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) becomes critical. Of course, any number of variables could impact these projections of 2035, from financial recessions to wars, food securities to pandemics, and political uncertainty to rapid urbanization and technological advances. But one thing’s certain— it is in these coming decades, cities are where many of these factors will converge and play out on the world stage.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/how-does-marketing-influence-businesses-and-consumers/", "title": "How does marketing influence businesses and consumers? | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "Marketing can be defined as an act of promotion or advertisement of selling products or services. It is the process of exploring, creating, and delivering value to meet the needs of the consumers by understanding the target consumer market and particular businesses. It has evolved into a new form especially due to the excessive use of social media. Due to the boost in the use of social media, it is easier for businesses to market and advertise their business or the products and services offered by them. It affects both businesses and consumers in a significant manner. In the words of Peter Drucker: “Because the purpose of business is to create a customer, the business enterprise has two–and only two–basic functions: marketing and innovation. Marketing and innovation produce results; all the rest are costs. Marketing is the distinguishing, unique function of the business.” Marketing doesn’t just “impact” a business – it is the function that saves a company from closing down. Marketing has various benefits for business such as – Marketing your business can have a huge impact on new businesses by creating large barriers for them to enter a well-established market. The new companies, brands, and businesses marketing, and advertisement can play a significant in making consumers aware of the products and services they are offering. While a company can sell out its products to larger customers. With the assistance of various marketing tactics, they can significantly improve their brand awareness and make their product more visible to a larger audience, which in turn increases both sales and revenue. Marketing can help in identifying the buying behavior of consumers as well. Whether you are a new company or an established one, they need to create awareness about their product to boost their sales and revenue. Making use of correct marketing tools can help businesses in reaching out to more customers, therefore, creating awareness about the product.   It has a huge impact on the functioning of the business. A business marketing strategy is what you offer, how you offer, and whom you offer. Whenever a company forms a marketing strategy they are thinking about the future success of the business. They make sure that they understand consumer needs, and what they want and they know how to communicate well with the target audience so they understand the offer they are offering. Inbound marketing has immensely modernized the way businesses undertake marketing and selling operations. It greatly helps in creating awareness and spreading the message about the product. Marketing trends are very essential to boost business. Some of the hottest trends in the market which can surely boost the business are – It means that consumers interact with the brands through chatbots and voice assistants. It is most commonly used in marketing campaigns. Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning are the reasons behind conversational marketing. In a recent study by IBM, it was found that more than 70% of users want instant answers to their queries. This is where conversational marketing can help them reach out to customers effectively and efficiently. It is a powerful way of driving sales and returns on investment (ROI). Brands using this can have a positive impact on their businesses. In no sense, influencer marketing has gained significant attraction in the past one to two years. brands use online influencers for their marketing campaigns through social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook. It includes influencers creating content by interacting with the product or services offered or with the employee of the business. Influencer marketing yields better results than conventional celebrity endorsements. They can easily interact with their followers which results in better engagement. Influencer marketing plays a significant role in consumer behavior and psychology such as recommendations. In recent times we have seen various brands like beardo, and Muscleblaze use influencers on Instagram to market their product. The influencers create content about the product and services offered which creates an online marketing campaign for the businesses. The content you post can have a significant impact on the development of the business. Personalized content can result in better consumer interaction. Big businesses like Netflix, Amazon, Spotify, etc. are some successful examples. If we take the example of Netflix, it automatically suggests movies and web series on the search history of the user, and the same is done by Spotify. Facebook makes use of an algorithm that determines the kind of content that should be shown on the user’s feed. Amazon makes use of users’ browsing and purchasing history while displaying products when we log in to it. Spotify Wrapped is one of the music streaming service’s most effective content marketing initiatives. Every year, around the New year, Spotify subscribers receive a wonderful compilation of all the songs they’ve listened to. The compilation is presented with graphics in vibrant colors and is divided into genres, years, musicians, and more. Users then have the option to share their wrapped playlists on social media, which is a crucial component that has caused the campaign to trend on social media every year since its beginning. Automation in marketing is making use of technology to automate marketing and advertising efforts. The covid-19 pandemic has significantly increased the use of technology and automation not only in marketing but in other sectors of the business as well. It may sound complex but automation in marketing is simple. Automated email sequences in sales and the upload of social media posts are all examples of Automation in marketing. Marketing automation allows businesses to scale their efforts to reach out to larger customers. More than 30% of business owners claim that marketing automation help with time-saving.  Their marketing team no longer needs to waste time repetitively focusing on tasks and can focus on optimization and content creation. Nissan gathers relevant data about its customers, including the time at which each vehicle was purchased. Six months after the automobile is acquired, they can utilize the purchase date to automatically send a reminder email to schedule the first service visit. This is an essential component of Nissan’s strategy because maintenance costs collected after the sale of the vehicle make up a significant part of Nissan’s overall earnings. By understanding, consumer behavior marketers can fill in the gap of how consumers buy a product and identify the product that is needed ad the obsolete products. Studying consumer behavior can help marketers to present the product in a way that yields higher consumer attraction. Understanding consumer behavior is the key secret to reaching out to more customers for brand recognition, engaging with the clients, and converting those into potential buyers. The primary responsibility of a marketing department is to grow the market share by acquiring and keeping new clients. The best way to do that is by monitoring, evaluating, and controlling consumer behavior. Modern marketing strategies easily handle this duty. Let’s examine the how and why in more detail. Regularly held marketing initiatives have a significant impact on consumers’ purchase decisions. They pick one brand over another just because they saw the first one’s advertisement more frequently. Customers tend to trust some businesses more than others simply because they have better blogs, and more visually appealing material and employ opinion leaders who help customers associate with the company favorably. Instead of informing consumers, modern marketing aims to convince and build strong emotional bonds with brands and products. Even if people can’t recall where or when they saw a specific advertisement, they may still experience a specific emotion when they look at a product at a store, such as happiness, comfort, or confidence. It occurs because the advertising they watched caused their brain to detect a particular emotion. The brain immediately connected the product with a certain emotion when they first viewed it. When buyers select from a variety of comparable products from various companies, this relationship will operate flawlessly. Nike advertises in a way that makes its customers comfortable. Its tagline, “Just Do It,” speaks for itself. Allowing everybody and everyone to come up with their meaning of the term makes it straightforward but to the point and helps the business build relationships with its customers. The audience is emotionally connected to this slogan. We believe that each of our social, professional, and informational settings is distinct. But in reality, we all live in a world of marketing where everything is offered for sale and purchased. It’s not good or bad; it’s simply the new commercial reality that dictates what you’ll wear tomorrow, how you’ll address your boss, and how much of your income you’ll spend on eating out. With a few notable exceptions, it is generally applicable to everyone, from a young wealthy nerd who is only 20 years old to a family in their late 30s. If you give it some more thought, you’ll realize that most of the material you encounter each day attempts to sell you something, such as a good, idea, an emotion, a political viewpoint, a way of acting, etc. Marketing strategies and tactics in all their forms and guises are what produce this entire environment. Take, for instance, the blogs of modern businesses. Rather than being sales tools, they appear to be thematic media. Companies work to position themselves as the go-to resource for information about a given industry by disseminating their knowledge of it to consumers. In this approach, they produce a ton of content, including viral material that shapes consumer trends and purchasing patterns. Today, public perception and reputation are even more valuable than actual goods. If it has a worthwhile message to convey and is effectively promoted, even a plain chicken egg can become viral and break Instagram records. Because it informs, equalizes, supports, engages, sells, and expands a business’s operations and offers, marketing is crucial for enterprises. It is equally important in the sense that it greatly influences the potential consumer behavior of the individual. If done correctly marketing can create a huge influence on both businesses and consumers.

Business\nglobalization that has happened over the previous few decades has made some\ncompanies more powerful than some national governments, making it easy for them\nto exploit inexpensive labor, plunder natural resources, causing severe impacts\nthrough pollution on the natural environment, human health, and biodiversity.\nUnfortunately for them, their horrible past has been catching up with them like\nin the case of child labor issues of IKEA & Nike, Rana Plaza accident in\nBangladesh affecting Zara, H&M and other clothing brands, environment\npollution by BP, Shell, Exxon Mobil etc. With the emergence of internet and\nsocial media these practices can no longer be covered up and silenced, the\nworld has become more educated and less tolerant and therefore with every\nmisdemeanor that is committed brand equity takes a hit. The media is fast\npicking up on cover-ups, half-truths, and bad corporate behavior and demanding\naccountability and transparency from corporates. Therefore to survive, companies\nare compelled to adopt sustainability and bring forth the rules for their\nsuppliers as well.  Many\nof the irresponsible company practices and disasters that are witnessed in that\nlast couple of decades were motivated solely by short-termism-   and the appeal of short-term performance\nincentives. For instance, deferred maintenance and slack leadership were to\nblame for the 1984 leaks from the pesticide plant Union Carbide India Ltd in\nBhopal. Estimates placed more than half a million casualties from the gas\ndischarge of the plant. Finally, Union Carbide Corporation’s 1989 litigation\npayout came out to today’s equivalent of nearly one billion US dollars. Another\nexample where the company was forced to shut down operations was Coca Cola at\nits Plachimada plant in Kerala. The local communities faced acute water\nshortage after the commissioning of the plant and the company authorities\nblatantly ignored the community woes. These businesses stated above didn’t\nrespect stakeholder engagement which ultimately lead to their untimely demise. Today’s\nissues cannot be solved without participation from all stakeholders, and\ncompanies with influence should be the torchbearers of change. They need to\nengage with regulators, communities, societies, suppliers, and NGOs for\neffective and desired outcomes. Issues where engagement are required include\npopulation growth; global middle-class growth; decline in ecosystems; water\nscarcity; food safety; material resource security; higher global energy demand;\nchanges in geographic patterns of energy consumption; and increasing climate\nchange regulatory interventions. By actively pursuing the triple\nbottom line, the essential possibilities available are: In order for companies to commit\nto sustainability they should have the below objectives in place: Sustainability -triple bottom line- can drive a company’s achievement beyond shareholder value creation by building  and help in addressing social &environmental problems. Several investors today use ESG metrics to evaluate the ethical effect and sustainability practices of an organization. Investors are looking at variables like the carbon footprint of a company, water use, community development efforts, and diversity board before investing. Companies have started responding to investors by publishing their annual sustainability reports. Research indicates that businesses with elevated ESG scores have reduced debt and equity costs and that sustainability projects can contribute to improving economic efficiency while encouraging government assistance. It’s only a matter of time, the flow of sustainability nourishes businesses in achieving holistic development for the environment, people and its profits.

The language used- python There are   that can be used for object detection. This includes, but not limited to, R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, SSD, YOLO, etc. including their multiple variants (Here’s a list of many of them- https://github.com/amusi/awesome-object-detection). Our use case requires us to have very fast algorithm capable of detecting objects in real-time. Depending on input both SSD and YOLO perform very well and can be used. Here, we are using pre-trained models based on YOLOv5 (https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5). We have used YOLOv5 for detecting objects as it performs well in real-time. It includes multiple pre-trained models. Pre-trained models available- These models are saved inside “weights” directory. The frames from the video are first converted into an array and then object detection is performed based on the smaller size of the original image (since we need high performance) using any of the given pre-trained models/checkpoints.  The bounding boxes are generated (which encloses the detected objects) and then data (pixels) inside the boxes for every object of every frame are stored as images inside a directory “detected_objects”. Similarly, frames are stored inside the “detected_frames” folder.  Meanwhile, video output is also generated at the end which is the original video but with detection boxes and objects labeled along with a percentage on how likely the detected object is likely to be correct from the data in the model.

In this project, we have created a python script that will extract the resumes and jobs from the specified database and then scores each resume against   based on the skills, title, and location of both resumes and jobs, and then these scores are updated into the database. First, we have calculated scores of skills, title, and location separately in the range of 0-100 and the calculated overall score combining those three scores in the range of 0-10 based on some predefined conditions and we have given the highest priority to the title then skills and at last location. For calculating the skill score, we preprocessed the resume details and job descriptions and extracted skills from both. After extracting skills we have calculated the percentage of skills matched in the resume with the job and then extracted the best skills in the resume to find the skill in which the resume is proficient and find the similarity with job title and calculated similarity score. Calculated skill score by averaging both percentage of skills matched and proficient skill similarity score. For calculating the title score we have used the word2vec model. First, we have trained a word2vec model on the whole corpus of resumes and jobs. Using this trained model calculated the similarity score between the job title and resume title and multiplied it by 100 to get the title score in the range of 0-100. Find the latitude and longitude of locations both in and used these to calculate the distance between job location and resume location. Scaling the distance between the range 0-100 after grouping them based on the country after that to calculate the location score subtracted the scaled distance so that lower the distance between locations higher the location score. Location score will be assigned as -1 If job location and resume location are in different countries.

In this research paper, we study the impact of Over-the-Top media on society as a whole especially after the pandemic when there was a sudden shift in remote work culture, educational practices being held online, families spending valuable time together, and majorly the access to viewers. Besides the convenience of receiving, the media has certain other advantages too. It has opened up the possibility of streaming ad-free content and undisturbed viewing. Also, the customer is truly the king here; he or she can watch what they want and when they want. However, there have been no studies so far that have examined the impact of OTT media on society, families, and individuals.  There has been a prodigious change over the past decade as how there has been a shift of television viewers to Over-the-Top platforms which are now easily accessible to anyone through the internet. The widespread availability of broadband internet has led to the emergence and steady rise to prominence of many platforms, including YouTube, Netflix, and HBO Go. By satisfying media-hungry consumers’ needs and adjusting to their increasingly busy lifestyles, these platforms have found success. The traditional TV-viewing experience is no longer restricted to real-time or the living room TV. Nowadays, users may consume content on laptops, tablets, portable devices, and gaming consoles whenever and wherever they want.  Especially the demand for OTT media and entertainment has seen a concurrent and large increase during the post-pandemic era, with internet usage increasing from 40% to 100% during that time. The widespread lockdowns have contributed to consumer awareness of the potential of OTT media services, enhancing their capacity to influence the daily consumption of content. By offering tailored content recommendations and focused adverts, media firms have also contributed to unlocking additional value for each of their unique viewers by utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Analytics. With the rise of cross-platform smart voice assistants ensuring the creation of a smart home ecosystem within the homes of the consumers, the transitions underway in the media and entertainment space enable customer-friendly easy content search with voice commands through Smart OTT Platforms will enhance customer experience by every passing day. India’s OTT streaming video market is currently in its second growth phase with total revenues of $3 billion in 2022. To know about the impact of OTT platforms in India, it is important to consider consumers’ passive involvement, and interests which helps in analyzing the last action. According to a survey by RBSA Advisors, India’s video OTT market is anticipated to grow from roughly USD 1.5 billion in 2021 to USD 12.5 billion by 2030 as a result of access to better networks, digital connections, and smartphones. According to the survey, Tier II, III, and Tier IV cities and the population who speak Indian languages would be responsible for the next wave of growth in the OTT environment. The significant expenditures made in original and acquired content by OTT services like Netflix, Amazon, Disney+ Hotstar, and others will assist subscription video-on-demand in making up 93% of the total OTT income (as opposed to 87%) while expanding at a CAGR of 30.7% between 2019 and 2024.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/evaluating-logistic-regression-models/", "title": "Evaluating Logistic Regression Models | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": " Logistic Regression Models are a technique that is well suited for examining the relationship between a categorical response variable and one or more categorical or continuous predictor variables. The model is generally presented in the following format, where   and x represents the independent variables. log(odds)=β0+β1∗x1+…+βn∗xn The log(odds), or log-odds ratio, is defined by ln[p/(1−p)] and expresses the natural logarithm of the ratio between the probability that an event will occur, p(Y=1), to the probability that it will not occur. We are usually concerned with the predicted probability of an event occurring and that is defined by p=1/1+exp^−z, where z=β0+β1∗x1+…+βn∗xn We will use the   dataset in the   package for this example. It contains   characteristics and  observations, with a target variable ( ) that is already defined. The response variable is coded   for bad consumers and   for good. It’s always recommended that one looks at the coding of the response variable to ensure that it’s a factor variable that’s coded accurately with a   scheme or two-factor levels in the right order. The first step is to partition the data into training and testing sets. Using the training dataset, which contains   observations, we will use logistic regression to model   as a function of five predictors. Bear in mind that the estimates from logistic regression characterize the relationship between the predictor and response variable on a log-odds scale. For example, this model suggests that for every one-unit increase in  , the log-odds of the consumer having good credit increases by 0.018. Because this isn’t of much practical value, we’ll usually want to use the exponential function to calculate the odds ratios for each preditor. This informs us that for every one-unit increase in  , the odds of having good credit increase by a factor of 1.01. In many cases, we often want to use the model parameters to predict the value of the target variable in a completely new set of observations. That can be done with the predict function. Keep in mind that if the model was created using the glm function, you’ll need to add   to the predict command. A logistic regression model has been built and the coefficients have been examined. However, some critical questions remain. Is the model any good? How well does the model fit the data? Which predictors are most important? Are the predictions accurate? The rest of this document will cover techniques for answering these questions and provide R code to conduct that analysis. For the following sections, we will primarily work with the logistic regression that I created with the   function. While I prefer utilizing the   package, many functions in   will work better with a   object.  Logistic Regression Models are said to provide a   if it demonstrates an improvement over a model with fewer predictors. This is performed using the likelihood ratio test, which compares the likelihood of the data under the full model against the likelihood of the data under a model with fewer predictors. Removing predictor variables from a model will almost always make the model fit less well (i.e. a model will have a lower log-likelihood), but it is necessary to test whether the observed difference in model fit is statistically significant. Given that H0 holds that the reduced model is true, a p-value for the overall model fit statistic that is less than 0.05 would compel us to reject the null hypothesis. It would provide evidence against the reduced model in favor of the current model. The likelihood ratio test can be performed in R using the   function from the   package or using the   function in base. Unlike linear regression with ordinary least squares estimation, there is no R2 statistic that explains the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the predictors. However, there are a number of pseudo R2 metrics that could be of value. Most notable is McFadden’s R2, which is defined as 1−[ln(LM)/ln(L0)] where ln(LM) is the log-likelihood value for the fitted model and ln(L0) is the log-likelihood for the null model with only an intercept as a predictor. The measure ranges from   to just under  , with values closer to zero indicating that the model has no predictive power. Another approach to determining the goodness of fit is through the Homer-Lemeshow statistics, which is computed on data after the observations have been segmented into groups based on having similar predicted probabilities. It examines whether the observed proportions of events are similar to the predicted probabilities of occurrence in subgroups of the data set using a Pearson chi-square test. Small values with large p-values indicate a good fit to the data while large values with p-values below 0.05 indicate a poor fit. The null hypothesis holds that the model fits the data and in the below example we would reject H0. A wald test is used to evaluate the statistical significance of each coefficient in the model and is calculated by taking the ratio of the square of the regression coefficient to the square of the standard error of the coefficient. The idea is to test the hypothesis that the coefficient of an independent variable in the model is significantly different from zero. If the test fails to reject the null hypothesis, this suggests that removing the variable from the model will not substantially harm the fit of that model. To assess the relative importance of individual predictors in the model, we can also look at the absolute value of the t-  This technique is utilized by the vamp function in the caret package for general and generalized linear models. When developing models for prediction, the most critical metric regards how well the model does in predicting the target variable on out-of-sample observations. The process involves using the model estimates to predict values on the training set. Afterward, we will compare the predicted target variable versus the observed values for each observation. In the example below, you’ll notice that our model accurately predicted 67 of the observations in the testing set. The receiving operating characteristic is a measure of classifier performance. Using the proportion of positive data points that are correctly considered as positive and the proportion of negative data points that are mistakenly considered as positive, we generate a graphic that shows the trade-off between the rate at which you can correctly predict something with the rate of incorrectly predicting something. Ultimately, we’re concerned about the area under the ROC curve, or AUROC. That metric ranges from 0.50 to 1.00, and values above 0.80 indicate that the model does a good job in discriminating between the two categories which comprise our target variable. Bear in mind that ROC curves can examine both target-x-predictor pairings and target-x-model performance. An example of both are presented below. When evaluating models, we often want to assess how well it performs in predicting the target variable on different subsets of the data. One such technique for doing this is k-fold cross-validation, which partitions the data into k equally sized segments (called ‘folds’). One fold is held out for validation while the other k-1 folds are used to train the model and then used to predict the target variable in our testing data. This process is repeated k times, with the performance of each model in predicting the hold-out set being tracked using a performance metric such as accuracy. The most common variation of cross-validation is 10-fold cross-validation.

Open CV is a cross-platform library, which has been suggested for applying SVMs for multiclass classification. They are “one against all” and “one against one”. A number plate region is located by using mean shift method and extracted; the histogram projection method in the horizontal direction is applied for a simple segmentation only. Automatic license plate recognition is a Computer Vision technique which is able to recognize a license plate number. This system is useful in many fields likes parking lots, private and public entrances, theft control. In this paper, we designed such a system.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/bank-risk-management-india/", "title": "Bank Risk Management in India | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "In the past 2 years, Indian banks have seen rapid growth in stressed assets with NPAs climbing from 3% to 13% of the total assets. In 2017-18 the GNPA ratio rose to 23.1 % from 18.1% last year. The primary culprits of this have been Public Sector Banks who have given and renewed loans to unworthy corporates like Nirav Modi, Kingfisher Airlines. Another big blow to the banking sector came in September 2018 in the form of IL & FS crisis. Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services, a publicly owned NBFC defaulted on loans worth Rs. 91000 Crore which led to a liquidity crisis across Indian NBFCs which had an impact on Indian banks as well. Due to these developments, the trust on Indian financial sector seems to be lost and the RBI is taking a set of measures to revive the financial sector. To control the situation, India had to definitely go for the curative strategy first. Insolvency and Bankruptcy code (IBC) was passed in 2016. It has proved to be a major shot in the arm for the banks to fight NPAs. Since then it also has been amended several times to give it more strength. The RBI also dissolved the existing Corporate Debt Restructuring (CDR) for more comprehensive frameworks like SDR (Strategic Debt Restructuring), S4A and 5/25. The new measures facilitate the conversion of outstanding loans into a majority shareholding in the company. Also, they allow that for even a single day of default, the bank can send the case to IBC  (Adhikari, 2018). In March 2018, RBI implemented the ban on lenders on issuing LOCs and LOUs for issuing overseas loans. Though such due diligence is good in preventing the NPAs, they have had limited effect only. Transition to SDR though a good move has not seen much success and in only one case it has shown some results, the case of Gammon India. IBC has met some success but there are many challenges like lack of infrastructure. So far only 11 NCLT benches have been set up across India. (Upadhyay, 2019) .The move to ban buyer’s credit has had an impact on trade financing in India. Importers used this instrument to avail of cheaper credit to pay suppliers. Post this ban, they will have to rely upon Bank guarantees which comes with its own limits. Also, the ban on LCs will mean that corporates who have taken LCs will have to pay back as there will be no rollover. (Archana & Gopakumar, 2018).  After addressing these challenges to curative strategy, it is important to implement a preventive strategy so that banks can prevent loan write-offs in the future. An important aspect related to this is the BASEL norms. BASEL is a city in Switzerland and it is the location of the headquarters of the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) which is the international body that sets rules for banking.  Currently, the Indian banks are transitioning to BASEL-III norms. BASEL-III norms have been implemented on April 1, 2013, and will be fully implemented as on March 31, 2020. One of the key shortcomings of the earlier BASEL accords was that it approached solvency of each institution independently. BASEL-III has set its objectives to improve the shock absorbing capacity of each and every individual bank as the first priority and in the worst case, if one or banks fail, it ensures that banking system as a whole does not crumble as a spill-over effect.  These aspects are illustrated in the figure given below: Clearly, the immediate effect has to be negative and it was visible in the year 2016 when PSBs posted significant losses. Fitch Ratings stated that the progressive increase in minimum capital requirements under Basel III is likely to put nearly half of Indian banks in danger of breaching capital triggers. Fitch estimates that Indian banks will require around USD90bn in new capital by FYE19 to meet Basel III standards, with the state banks accounting for about 80% of the total. (Hindu Business Line, 2018). Due to this, the Government has to extend the deadline to implement BASEL-III norms for Indian banks by a year. (Hindu Business Line, 2018). After studying all this, one thing is clear that implementing BASEL-III norms even in next year won’t be a cakewalk. The banks need to overhaul their risk management practices in order to bring this regulatory change. While on one hand, BASEL-III increases cost in the form of technological investment it also presents an opportunity it presents an opportunity for banks to assess their operations and look for opportunities to create efficiency. In the long run, it will influence banks to move to a culture of risk and evidence-based decision making. (Cognizant, 2013). Technology has to take a central role in risk management to bring operational efficiency. The organization needs to break silos and work as a single unit to discover insights where it needs to improve.

These algorithms use graph theory to calculate the importance of any given node in a network. They cut through noisy data, revealing parts of the network that need attention – but they all work differently. Each measure has its own definition of ‘importance’, so you need to understand how they work to find the best one for your  Degree centrality: A network of terrorists, repeatedly filtered by degree (also known as a k-degenerate graph) revealing clusters of tightly connected nodes  Degree centrality assigns an importance score based simply on the number of links held by each node.  How many direct, ‘one hop’ connections each node has to other nodes in the network.  For finding very connected individuals, popular individuals, individuals who are likely to hold most information, or individuals who can quickly connect with the wider network.  Degree centrality is the simplest measure of node connectivity. Sometimes it’s useful to look at in-degree (number of inbound links) and out-degree (number of outbound links) as distinct measures, for example when looking at transactional data or account activity. Visualizing , with nodes resized by betweenness score  Betweenness centrality measures the number of times a node lies on the shortest path between other nodes.  This measure shows which nodes are ‘bridges’ between nodes in a network. It does this by identifying all the shortest paths and then counting how many times each node falls on one.  For finding the individuals who influence the flow around a system.  Betweenness is useful for analyzing communication dynamics, but should be used with care. A high betweenness count could indicate someone holds authority over disparate clusters in a network, or just that they are on the periphery of both clusters. A corporate email network; nodes with a high closeness degree are enlarged  Closeness centrality scores each node based on their ‘closeness’ to all other nodes in the network.  This measure calculates the shortest paths between all nodes, then assigns each node a score based on its sum of shortest paths.  For finding the individuals who are best placed to influence the entire network most quickly.  Closeness centrality can help find good ‘broadcasters’, but in a highly connected network, you will often find all nodes have a similar score. What may be more useful is using Closeness to find influencers in a single cluster. An email network, with nodes sized by their EigenCentrality  Like degree centrality, EigenCentrality measures a node’s influence based on the number of links it has to other nodes in the network. EigenCentrality then goes a step further by also taking into account how well connected a node is, and how many links their connections have, and so on through the network.  By calculating the extended connections of a node, EigenCentrality can identify nodes with influence over the whole network, not just those directly connected to it.  EigenCentrality is a good ‘all-round’ SNA score, handy for understanding human social networks, but also for understanding networks like malware propagation.  Our tools calculate each node’s EigenCentrality by converging on an eigenvector using the power iteration method. An email network, with nodes sized by   PageRank is a variant of EigenCentrality, also assigning nodes a score based on their connections, and their connections’ connections. The difference is that PageRank also takes link direction and weight into account – so links can only pass influence in one direction, and pass different amounts of influence.  This measure uncovers nodes whose influence extends beyond their direct connections into the wider network.  Because it takes into account direction and connection weight, PageRank can be helpful for understanding citations and authority.  PageRank is famously   behind the original Google search engine (the ‘Page’ part of its name comes from creator and Google founder, Sergei Brin).

Nearly everyone in the app’s development or marketing realm should track these. How much weight or consideration each carries depends on the app itself. You will want to track this to ensure that your user base   growing, and  . Does it spike due to particular events (such as changes in price, app updates, and other activities)? Or is it slow and steady? Here’s the formula for your user growth rate: The number of times that an app gets downloaded to a device is perhaps the simplest and most obvious way to track its popularity among users. Of course, you should track app downloads, as this KPI is the foundation that most KPIs are built on. The fact that someone downloaded an app doesn’t mean that they completed the setup process. Therefore, you should also be tracking actual installations on the various devices that your audience uses. Someone can decide to uninstall your app for any number of reasons and they won’t always leave feedback or give a reason why. However, if the uninstalls correspond with an update or changes in your app (or advertising methods or targeting), you should consider what happened and why — especially if the uninstalls occurred in clusters or were performed by a previously stable user base. Deciding whether or not to register (and therefore give up their personal data) is another sign that users are buying what you are selling, at least figuratively. Plus you can use their email addresses or other contact info to market future upgrades and other apps to them. If users are failing to sign up for your app after downloading it, it’s time to review your onboarding flow.  If subscribing to new content or other updates is a feature you offer, you should be tracking the number of signups and unsubscribes. Besides, keeping track of how long it takes users to subscribe once they have installed the app — as well as the average subscription length — tells you more about the behavior of your users. Of course, if a user downloads and installs an app and it crashes frequently, that is not ideal. Keeping track of the number of crashes that occur and when in the user process they happen is necessary to improve the performance, the user experience, and the app retention metrics of your app. If you offer the option to upgrade your app to a premium or paid version, track the number and timing of upgrades. How long does it take a user who has installed or registered for the app to upgrade? Is the upgraded version rated higher than the basic version or are they similarly rated? All of the former show the level of engagement your users have with the app and the depth of financial commitment they might be willing to make. This is essential data when you’re attempting to calculate the valuation of your mobile app. Other key performance indicators measure how users engage with the app, including how, when, and where they use it and in which ways they connect or engage with your mobile app. The number of users that come back or return after a given period has passed. Retaining users is generally an indicator of creating a “sticky” or valuable app because people use it on a regular or more consistent basis.  from the app. = number of customers at the end of the period  = number of new customers acquired during this period   = number of customers at the start of the period The number of sessions you generate — also referred to as the number of times a user opens up the app — is an indicator of popularity and “stickiness” since the more sessions a user creates and that an app receives, the better. Keep in mind that in digital analytics, a session is a user or device-specific group of interactions that occur on your website or app within a given time frame. Therefore, defining what a session means for your particular app or project is essential. You can additionally calculate “stickiness” by dividing your   by your  . The amount of time that users spend on the app per session. Generally, the more time a user spends on the app, the better, but you may also want to look at session length, as it is related to the number of crashes and uninstalls, and see if there is a correlation. On the other hand, depending on your app’s functionality and goals, you may not need users to stay long to convert or take the desired action. In that case, the number of session intervals, AOR or depth of sessions may be a more useful KPI to track. The amount of time between sessions e.g., Do users visit every day or every week? More than once per day? Shorter intervals are usually better. This KPI for mobile apps can also be tied to content updates or other timely events to consider with your app. For instance, if there is new content to view every morning, then your session intervals are likely to be 24 hours or so; on the contrary, if your app isn’t tied to a particular time of day or event, shorter session intervals might be more desirable. The number of interactions per session, or how far someone goes on the user journey before closing a session or the app. For instance, going from browsing to making a purchase or leveling up in a game may signify more session depth than logging and checking for new content or using an app that requires only a short time to take advantage of its functionality, like a photo editor or calculator. The number of unique pages or URLs that a user hits during each visit, averaged. Usually, the higher the number, the better for your app, particularly if you rely on advertising for monetization — more screens equals more views or impressions. The number of active users who use the app daily. Averaging the number of DAUs over a month or year is a common way to discern a valuation or the future growth of a project. The number of active users of the app on a monthly basis. Keep in mind that these are tracked as unique visitors who may visit for multiple sessions, so it is useful to pay attention to both app usage metrics. The number of times your app is recommended or shared on social media. The higher the number, the better. Still, don’t forget to check when and where your app is shared and in what context. This is especially important if you have any social media functionality or integration built into your app. There are several different ways to define brand awareness, including how many times your brand appears in the search engine results, on various social networks or the “reach” of your brand. The more users are aware of your brand, the better, but you also want to analyze the diversity of brand mentions. The rate at which active users unsubscribe or uninstall your app. . A high one is potentially indicative of functionality problems elsewhere that can be determined by checking when and where the app crashes or users log out or drop off. Money may not be  , but it is certainly important. And you probably want your app to be profitable or financially stable in some way, shape or form. Therefore, you will need to measure how it’s generating revenue using metrics like the following KPIs for apps. The average amount of value or cash generated per user via in-app purchases, ad impressions or clicks, subscriptions, paid downloads, or other forms of monetization. Multiplied by the size of the user base or the number of active users, this figure gives a good rough idea of the value of the app as a whole. The lifetime value of a user is the amount of revenue they’ve generated for your app thus far. Combined with the average revenue per user, it can be a great way to determine the total prospective revenue or value of an app. This mobile app KPI is about the amount of time it takes a user who has downloaded and installed the app to make a purchase, whether that is an in-app purchase, an e-commerce purchase, or buying a premium or otherwise upgraded version of the app. This is a relatively simple and necessary number to track if your app involves any kind of exchange of funds, whether they are in-app purchases, upgrades to a premium version, subscriptions or an e-commerce play. The cost of acquiring a new customer, e.g., the money spent advertising your app, including the time factored in for marketing costs — time is money, after all. You can determine this number by dividing the total gross revenue during a given period by the sales and marketing costs incurred during the same period. The cost per acquisition of a conversion. This mobile app KPI doesn’t necessarily imply the conversion comes from a new customer but from a new behavior, such as signing up for a subscription, upgrading to a premium or higher level, in-app purchases, or giving new permissions. The lifetime value of a customer based on the net profit they generate over time. In this case, it depends on their spending — in and on the app — in proportion to the cost required for their acquisition. A user pool with a high average CLV is a tremendous asset for a mobile app. Keep in mind that successful apps tend to have an excellent CLV to CAC ratio.   The actual or effective cost of acquiring new customers, including organic discovery methods, paid advertising, and time spent or other expenses incurred during the marketing process. Calculate it by comparing the number of new customers to the total number of impressions generated by marketing campaigns while factoring in the cost of those campaigns. The actual cost per 1,000 impressions or actions, including organic and paid marketing efforts along with the cost of time spent or other expenses incurred. This can be calculated by factoring in the number of impressions or views generated by marketing efforts divided by the number of customers gained. The rate of conversion via paid advertising. It includes PPC advertising, display ads, social media ads (e.g., promoted Tweets or boosted Facebook posts), sponsored posts or reviews, or any other method of marketing your mobile app that involves a direct exchange of money for mentions or views. The rate of conversion via unpaid discovery, such as organic search,word of mouth mentions on social media, influencer marketing, public relations mentions and buzz, related apps in the app store listings, or any other way of marketing your mobile app that doesn’t involve direct paid advertising. The return on investment for any marketing tactics or techniques is calculated by dividing the number of gains in customers or revenue generated by how much you spent on marketing — including time or any expenses incurred. Cost per install measures your customer acquisition costsfor customers that installed your app after seeing an advertisement. It tracks paid installs rather than organic ones. User experience is perhaps the main factor concerning whether a mobile app succeeds or fails. Accordingly, using these mobile app analytics KPIs and others to track, measure and improve on it might be the most important activity you can engage in as a mobile app developer or marketer. The amount of time it takes an app to leadfrom the initial tap to being ready to use. It also applies to in-app screens and how long it takes the user to transition from one screen or activity to another. . You almost always want your load times to be as low as possible. Another relatively simple KPI to define and track is which devices your audience uses to access your app. Depending on your target clientele, it is essential to know if they usually use tablets versus smartphones, Android versus iOS or other specific devices. Then you can target your app’s performance accordingly. The devices used to access your app are only part of the equation. You should also know which carriers your user base tends to prefer, in particular, if you are targeting a particular geographic region. This is overwhelmingly a question of Android versus iOS for both users and developers — although your app should work well on both. If there is a high crash or uninstall rate for either OS or if your user base prefers Apple or Android, that is something to consider. Try to get to the bottom of why it is happening and solve any problems that these preferences may indicate. This KPI is almost always related to the devices that your customers use to access your app. It is something to consider when making updates and future versions. Correlate it with mobile app performance metrics like uninstalls or crashes. The amount of access or permissions that your customers allow via your app. This is the time interval between your API proxies being called or triggered and their response or load time. In general, you want this number to be low. This KPI for apps is tied to load time and the corresponding user behaviors. There are plenty of key performance indicators tied to the effectiveness of how you market your application. Choosing the mobile marketing KPIs that track your preferred or most effective methods is essential, along with measuring your app growth and mentions on social media and influencer networks. Naturally, you should also be reporting on any paid advertising and monitoring your app store analytics to see what is driving downloads. The platform and referral source where your customers discover and install your app is a key piece of knowledge that will inform the rest of your campaign. Is it via paid ads or links, organic mentions, or some combination of the two, and what is that ratio? What sources are the most and least successful? Which app store do they use, and how do they get to your app’s page (keyword search, inbound link, social media promotion, etc.)? If you want to track this, you can do more of the same regarding successful sources and lower or adjust your marketing methods to the less advantageous ones. This is the viral popularity or word of mouth surrounding your mobile app marketing. Virality can be measured in different ways, but a common method is to calculate the k factor by multiplying the number of mentions (organic or paid) by the corresponding conversion percentage. However, you track virality, determine one way of tracking it from the beginning and stick with it for the most complete and cohesive results. The range and type of channels that users use to access your application. Generally, you want to aim for a variety in sources along with analyzing the type of source as it relates to its popularity with your target demographics and how the users who arrived via various channels behave once they download and install your app. The geographic location of your users — and subsequently their language too — may affect in-app purchases and ad revenue. This mobile app metric can also inform your future mobile app marketing campaigns by letting you know which locations to target and which are already saturated. The gender, ethnicity, and age of your audience. Tracking the demographics of your actual customer base as it compares to your target audience is an excellent way to judge the effectiveness of your marketing efforts. Your user base can likely be grouped into several categories or collectives based on demographics, locations, in-app behaviors, or other common characteristics. Grouping your users and seeing the patterns in their behavior can be a valuable learning experience or source of knowledge about your current and potential customers. The behaviors that are unique to your app can be a valuable insight into your audience’s minds. This mobile app KPI applies to how the users arrived at your app and what they do once they download it. It can also include other apps they have downloaded, social networks they participate in or websites they actively visit. Essentially, tracking behavioral metrics allows you to create a collection of user profiles and develop app features and marketing plans that tap into and take advantage of these behaviors. Perhaps the most important part of marketing and promoting your mobile app is the app store experience and how it attracts users — how they discover your app, decide whether to install and purchase it, and rate and review it. Keywords or phrases that caused users to discover and download your app. Tracking the user path from the initial keyword search to the eventual purchase will let you see which keywords actually generate revenue and other positive or desired behaviors.   Monitoring your rankings over time and studying how they affect your app’s performance is essential and, in general, the better your ranking the better your performance. The number of times a user viewed your app listing before installing it. In general, the lower number of views to install, the better. It shows that your advertising and app store listing are effective. The more positive reviews you get, the better. Also, be attentive to the total number of them since that shows users are passionate and engaged enough to take the time to write a review of your app. Negative reviews also give you a chance to learn from critics what to improve, while positive reviews can show you features that you should boost, augment, or even consider upgrading to a premium version or a spin-off app. Sometimes you can learn the most about what people want from this kind of direct feedback. Like app store reviews, the more positive ratings you get and the higher the average rating or score, the better. That said, because it takes less effort to rate an app, the number of ratings is not as indicative of passion or engagement as reviews are. Of course, not all mobile app KPIs and metrics are created equal when it comes to measuring a mobile app’s success or placing value on a given app. There are lots of key performance indicators that mobile app developers should consider at various points in the creation process. However, distilling all these apps into a coherent report or cohesive analysis — making them tell a story — is easier said than done.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/advance-analytics-for-refocusing-profits/", "title": "Advance Analytics for Refocusing Profits | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "Recent years have seen significant growth in personal financial wealth. In 2017 alone, there was more than 12 percent growth in personal financial wealth. Opportunities posed by this growth are tremendous, but the wealth managers are struggling to manage their profit margins or increase their profit margins. This is due to a plethora of causes like stricter regulation by the institution, increase in demanding customer and digital disruption. Still, the top performers in the segment are enjoying more margin than others and this difference is continuously increasing. Revenue is more important than the cost reduction in driving profits. Top performers – those with higher pre-tax profit margins – achieved a significant advantage over average performer by focusing on revenue growth and return on assets in past years, along with significantly better price realization in every client segment – as cited by a researcher from BCG. The top performer also enjoys a cost advantage, but that is less pronounced than ROA. This suggested that the revenue is the main driver for profit margin. The manager can achieve higher revenue by adjusting price levels, removing unnecessary discounts and simplifying overall pricing structure. Pricing information is easily available, combining with analytics and data tools, they become truly powerful. The manager should understand the present abnormalities and inconsistent for optimizing the pricing opportunities and driving the margins. They can focus on two major areas. Firstly, the realization of pricing offered to the client. Managers often give discounts to book business at the expense of revenue margin. Company’s weak guidance for discounting the customer and infrequent review of the existing discounts exemplifies the issue. Furthermore, often the manager fails to apply fees increase to the existing clients. Using the value-based pricing – offering discounts based on requirement and timely removal of the discount – the system will help in capitalizing this revenue gap. Secondly, designing the pricing system for the organization. Pricing should be based on the value generated and perceived by the customer. Most of the existing pricing is complex and opaque, which makes it difficult for the customer (even the Manager) to understand. This creates an improper product bundle and misprices offering to the customer. Organization loosely defines the client segment, which extends the pricing benefit beyond the intended client segment. Implementing smart pricing system can significantly drive the revenue. A successful pricing transformation should consider various factors like adjustment to deal with pricing outliers, stringent policies for tracking and reporting the realization of the price at client and manager level, manager’s training and coaching, and incentives to the manager for implementing the smart pricing system. Some managers may have misperceived risk of client attrition. In recent research, it has been found that clients are not specially priced sensitive. Most of the clients have very low awareness about the fees that managers charges. Though they appreciate discount they are not aware of what exactly has been offered to them. Importantly, most clients focus far more on the overall experience they receive. By increasing the overall client experience and satisfaction, the organization can reap remarkable benefits. A content customer shows certain kinds of behavior – hard to quantify – leads to increased and stable revenue. They tend to use more of institutional services and refers to their friends and relatives. According to recent research, the building block of selection and retention of content clients are trust, reassurance, personalized experience, convenience and investment performance on par with other service providers. Moreover, clients expectation and needs change with time, the service provider must change to cater to those needs. A service provider must be able to provide a personalized experience and meet the changing needs of the client. Personalize experience can be created by leveraging the full spectrum of existing data and using advanced analytics to make a personalized profile based on customer needs, preferences, context, and experience. Sharp execution of customized experience from delivering the standard experience is challenging. For accomplishing this enormous task, firms need to develop a new cutting-edge technology based advance analytics capacities using a new technology platform, next-generation technology, and data architecture, and improved access to the internal and external data. Some players are taking actions in smaller steps by developing a small and new analytics team, and investing in a new platform. Customer experience can be further enhanced by generating curated communication and finding the optimal frequency and medium for communication using analytics. Such analytics can also flag ways to reduce unwanted communication and an ideal time for initiating cross-selling and drive a customer toward research and investment ideas in specific sectors. Moreover, it will also maximize the Relationship Manager(RM) efficiency by defining the adequate frequency of client communication (especially for low-frequency communication client). RM could divide his crucial time propositional to the real value of the client to the firm. Refined procedure or sequence can be established for client communication in case of market abnormally for reassurance and retention. This optimization will help RM to increase the portion of time toward client acquisition, which will directly impact business expansion. \nAdvanced analytics can also increase the top line growth in addition to the above-mentioned points. Analytics can identify the early signs of potential client attrition by observing the trading pattern. In a few recent cases, the firm was able to identify the possible client attrition by observing the trading pattern and able to mitigate by successful communication. In these cases earlier the identification easier for firms to retain clients. Few recent research has shown that the firm can decrease the client attrition by 10 to 20% using specific analytics technique. Furthermore, sharpen the target price based on client-specific price sensitivity, individual scenario, and long term perspective. The dynamic pricing model can also be created. The success of the advanced analytics will depend on having or developing a foundation of the key capabilities. Combining them effectively and managing the complexity will need tenacious leadership. Few of the key capabilities that the firm should look for are cutting edge technology architecture, sharp data capture and governance, innovative analytics capabilities, and change management. With cutting edge technology there is no single solution for all players. It varies from players and market, and the firm must be ready to iterate for the ideal technology. But the technology should provide a single outcome to the result and able to find relevant data from the large pool of structured and unstructured data. Major challenges lie in capturing and structuring already existing data. The specific history of the client, or winning strategy for specific clients. The firm can develop a model to capitalize and analyze the technique used by experience RM toward acquisition, retaining and deriving customer satisfaction for specific clients. This model will be difficult to build because most of the data variable will be difficult to quantify. A firm must develop their innovative analytics capabilities, for creating difficult models and improving the analysis of currently available data. Knowing how to apply the right analytics method to a business problem requires a different type of investment other than system and data. Taking the first step is the most difficult point for the firm. The firm can take one of the two most common practice approaches. Firstly, firms can create a detailed road map. Then invest in the required capabilities and makes necessary organizational changes accordingly. Secondly, Learning by doing, rapidly creating and prioritizing a long list of use cases specific to the firm. The second case has a higher chance of success for the firm.

Banking, being the backbone of every country, plays a vital role in the development of the financial system of an economy. Banking helps to boost the financial system of an economy.  Since the last two decades, the size of data has grown by a huge amount and value. Storage of information in digital form has already taken place in India. Due to digitalization, a large amount of data has become feasible to utilize. Investments in Big Data analytics in the banking sector was around $20 billion in 2016, as per the IDC semi-annual big data and analytics spending guide of 2016. The four Vs of big data (velocity, volume, variety, and veracity) have impacted the banking sector at various points in time.  The size of available data has been growing at an increasing rate. This applies to companies and to individuals.  Velocity is the measure of how fast the data is coming in.  It stands for the plenitude of data types processed, and the banks do have to deal with huge numbers of various types of data.  Uncertainty due to data inconsistency and incompleteness. Big data has applications in various branches in the banking and finance sectors such as Marketing, Risk management, operations, etc. Since it gives an advantage over competitors, it is a source of profit for financial institutions. Big data analytics companies evaluate the risk of various customers of banks and financial institutions. Data analytics helps to remove the biases taken in management decisions. Risk analytics plays an important role in Fraud analytics, Credit policy, and Modelling. The spending patterns and previous credit history of a customer can help rapidly assess the risks of issuing a loan. In March 2014, there were only 5,090 wilful defaulters who defaulted on Rs 39,504 crore. This grew steadily over the years to number 11,046 wilful defaulters and Rs 161,213 crore by December 2018,  Financial Institutions have a sufficient amount of data in order to realize and mitigate the future risk posing from their customers. There are Data Science Startups tied up with different financial institutions to asses the risk of their customers. Currently, there are approximately 60,000 data science and financial analytics professionals in India, working in the finance sector. Rubix Data Sciences Pvt Ltd company is a Startup which asses the credit risk of their clients. These companies have expertise in managing and monitoring the customers of their clients on a real time basis through data analytics.  One of the biggest factors is social media, which has opened new avenues and opportunities for organizations to connect with their customers. However, the huge volume of brands, products, and services, discussed, shared, criticized or liked on different social platforms can be overwhelming. Sentiment analytics helps to rapidly read all this data and provide a summary of what people like and do not like about a company or its products. It helps the company make better decisions on their products. Through analytics the customer segmentation and profiling on the basis of customer spending patterns, for instance, a person who is a heavy loan payer may exhaust all his income at once, can help the banks or financial institutions to plan the bottom line and maximize their income. With the help of big data analytics, banks can analyze the market trends and decide on lowering or increasing interest rates for different individuals across various regions. Data analytics tools are used by the RBI to monitor inflation on a real-time basis. The financial system is now completely computerized, as large volumes of data are generated on a daily basis. A dynamic database of bank lending activity could help a regulator spot outlier activity that may lead to trouble later. This assumes that data across the banking sector is aggregated. Trends in retail lending can also be spotted by plugging into the databases of consumer credit rating agencies. Big data analytics can help to analyze the ongoing activity in the financial system and mitigate the upcoming risk. In spite of tightening regulations, there are financial frauds in companies. As mentioned previously the list of defaulters in the last five years has increased drastically. Tracking the spending patterns of an individual can help to develop stringent regulations for high spending individuals and vice-versa.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/fitting-piecewise-growth-models-in-r/", "title": "Fitting Piecewise Growth Models in R | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "This is a simple walkthrough on how to specify a piecewise linear growth model in R using the lme4 package. Just as a quick outline, I will start with a simple linear growth pattern, then extend the logic to look at piecewise growth. Here is an example just simulating linear growth. We will assume that everyone follows the same linear pattern over time, with some random variability around both the intercept and slope parameters. For this example, I’m simulating 100 participants with 6 timepoints each. The intercept is 10, while the slope is -2. The intercept and slope will also be positively correlated. This indicates that participants who start higher (i.e., a higher intercept) tend to have more positive change, compared to those who start lower (i.e., a lower intercept). You can see that I simulated the dataset to be in long format. I also started Time at 0, so the intercept would be interpreted as the mean of the first measure. Using spaghetti plots, we can visualize what the simulated data look like. We see that the intercept is around 10, with a decreasing slope around 2. This should not be a surprise, given those are the parameters we simulated. For this example, we are going to use lme4 to create a mixed-effects model. Here we have observations nested within individual. In this case, time will be a level-1 predictor. We will also allow both intercept and time to vary systematically around our intercept and slope estimates (and this variation between intercept and slope also has a covariance). In this output, we are first presented with random effects. This tells us that the intercept has a variance of around 4 and the slope for Time has a variance of around 2. Again, this is similar to what we simulated. Next are the fixed effects, and we capture the original parameters quite accurately. Now, here is an example simulating two growth patterns. In this case, I’m still simulating 100 participants with 6 timepoints. However, this time I will assume no growth for the first 3 time points, followed by a decline in the next 3 time points. The intercept will still be 10, and the slope for the second piece will still be -2. To make things a little easier, no correlation between intercept and either slope will be simulated. This time, I have two time variables: Time1 and Time2. As you can imagine, Time1 represents the first growth pattern, while Time2 represents the second. The intercept is the score when both time variables are 0, which is the third datapoint for each person. Model building for this model seems like it should be complex, but it really is just as simple as including the second time variable as both a fixed and random effect. From the output, we see the variance components for each random effect. These are interpreted the same: they tell us how variable our sample is with regard to each component. The fixed-effects are about 10 for our intercept, around 0 for the first slope, and -2 for the second slope. Just as was simulated, this model tells us the data seem to be relatively stable throughout the baseline, then declining after baseline. Including additional predictors/interactions with time follow logically from the above example.

Any change in one part of the world will always lead to some #changes in other parts of the world as well, maybe a bit later but surely there will be some change and that is what we are seeing in today’s world.   are the change that we are seeing in today’s world. With so many advancements in technology, economies are getting bigger. China might surpass the US and become a #superpower, we will have India inching towards a 15 trillion economy by 2040 and there will be competition among themselves to outshine the other. We are also seeing a   toward a more   from a unipolar world where powers are moving towards certain clusters of the world and everyone wants to be a part of these clusters. But in all these rearrangements taking place. We are in a way creating a better and more   life for our present as well as our future generations.  We have witnessed the COP26 where we saw leaders of top countries taking pledges to create a more sustainable future and the answer lies in a safer and greener planet and electric vehicles occupy a huge chunk of it. Internal combustion engines have already peaked, and electric vehicles are getting cheaper and cheaper as   of every country are actively pushing for electric vehicles as we have seen the joint statement in Cop 26 that “As business fleet owners and operators, or shared mobility platforms, we will work towards 100% of our car and van fleets being zero emission vehicles by 2030, or earlier”. This is a step towards the future. India which is home to a large number of two-wheelers and three-wheelers constitutes more than 70% of global sales and more than 80% in India is also a signatory to this statement.   And if we analyze it properly- crude oil, coal, and gas are the most demanded natural resource still in the world. But it’s not free and with the latest scenarios in and around the world, it’s #better to switch to a more safe, efficient, and   electric vehicle. If we look at the   of electric vehicles, it will surely improve the livelihood of society and in turn the world. EVs are on track to rise to 20% of China’s total market by 2025, up from 6% in 2020, and to 37% in the EU, from 11% last year. In the U.S., they are forecast to reach 10% by 2025. India is also not lagging. India’s EV market is still nascent and is forecast to record a 2.4% CAGR from 2020 to 2025. Electrification is expected to penetrate cars and last-mile connectivity modes like two-wheelers in India by 2030. It is expected about 70% of two-wheeler fleets and 30% of private two-wheelers to be electric by 2030. For passenger vehicles, 40% of fleets and 15%-20% of private cars will be electric by that time.  There are also different steps taken by the government like #tax exemptions, schemes like PLI,  . We must also note that it is estimated that around 10 million direct jobs will be created and indirectly almost 50 million jobs will be created around this sector. If we look at the global picture we are also seeing that there is a   between battery vehicles and ICE vehicles and with so many advancements in technology we are seeing the prices of batteries coming down with more players getting involved in it with prices estimated to be further down. As a world leader, countries like China and the USA are in a race to build more lithium-ion batteries so that they are   and have the capabilities to further rise to the occasion of being a major exporters in the world. The European Union is also not lagging as they are also trying to catch up by producing enough batteries to be self-sufficient by 2025. Crude oils are increasing day by day. We have seen a shortage of gas in European countries mainly due to the Russia- Ukraine war and everybody is trying to find an alternative to gas and crude oil as it is harmful and it’s one of the main reasons why   is such a havoc in the world. One of the major problems of Crude oils is oil spilling which is endangering marine species. Air pollution caused due to petrol and diesel vehicles is also affecting our planet and if there is less oil then there is less pollution as alternative drivetrains, fuel economy, and shared mobility will impact oil demand; however, nations still won’t reach net-zero by 2050 without doing more. Coal is also a great contributor to this pollution   associated with using coal as an energy source are particulate emission, ground-level ozone, smog, and acid rain. Coal and fuel oil combustion emit fly ash particles into the atmosphere, which contribute to air pollution problems. Though it is said that prices of crude oil haven’t peaked yet, they will surely peak by 2040. So, we need to foresee the future to have an alternative in society though we still can’t reach a complete outwash of oil in 2050 we can make sure that other alternatives are ready and self-sufficient. Well,   are also a major reason why we should consider EVs as our future. We realize that the max range of an electric vehicle will be around 350-390 km so people need to stop somewhere to recharge their batteries for at least 40-50 minutes which can provide a time frame in which people can avail restaurants explore shopping complexes and what not. This will help in generating employment opportunities in #hubs like these. There is also a rush in countries like China, the USA, and the European Union to build charging stations like this which will accelerate the process of EV vehicles. In this fast, paced world almost every alternative family is having a car but if public vehicles like buses and trains can be changed into electric vehicles this can boost the economy as a whole by creating greater needs with more opportunities in these sectors such as transportation and communication are very much a building block of today’s nation-building process.  However, if we are talking about a world that is greener and fitter we must realize and understand that Electric vehicles do have a   to this planet. There is a huge amount of electric waste which is not so concerning in today’s world. It might be a concern in the world we are all planning to live in. Electric vehicles and batteries need rare materials which are not easy to find. Electronic waste, also known as  , is any electronic product, or product containing electronic components, that has reached the end of its usable life cycle. Unbeknownst to many consumers, electronics contain toxic substances – therefore they must be handled with care when no longer wanted or needed. There are also negative effects on soil When the improper disposal of e-waste in regular landfills or in places where it is dumped illegally, both heavy metals and flame retardants can seep directly from the e-waste into the soil, causing contamination of underlying groundwater or contamination of crops that may be planted nearby or in the area in the future. Therefore, we must also not only focus on solely electric vehicles but also on other kinds of fuels like green hydrogen fuels like ethanol which can be generated from agricultural waste. Companies play an important part in this change. Rather than making it only electric, they should try to make vehicles that are hybrid in nature. They can switch engines so that they are ready to switch from petrol or diesel to green hydrogen and ethanol and also to electric vehicles.

Now, what does the word risk mean… it’s a fear of losing something of value, many times in monetary terms. The same saying goes for any financial institution. Bank operates in a dynamic business environment and faces multiple risks. With risk, comes the concept of risk management. Risk management refers to the identification and assessment of potential risk and the development and execution of plans to deal with such risks. In the banking industry, risk management focuses on managing the bank’s exposure to losses or risk and to protect the value of its assets, revenue, operations, business, and reputation. To understand the future of Bank risk management,\nlet us quickly go through the major banking risk one by one –  Now how the\nfuture of the Bank Risk Management will look like – Banking risk management will undergo a major change from what it looks now, as there will be new challenges for the business. Customers want real-time service and update, which will require huge investments in technology and Artificial intelligence. There would be pressure on banks to provide real-time services with a reduced cost (affecting bank margins). With the financial crises day on day, new regulatory norms are introduced, maintaining a strict check on liquidity and capital adequacy. The bank needs to invest in proper IT infrastructure which is not only reliable but also flexible. Upcoming Fintech startups will also add on to the strategic risk of the banks. Not to forget the Cyber risk which will become one of the top risks for banks in the coming decade. To cope with the above risks, banks need to put more robust and reliable risk management in place. By the end of this decade, or even earlier, the active approach of the financial institutions in handling the risk functions will determine its success or failure. They need a have proactive approach in identifying, assessing and mitigating risk through better IT infrastructure, machine intelligence, better resources allocation/mapping, real-time analytics, and internal control frameworks. However, one can bet that the future will belong to those who will have a go-ahead approach in identifying, assessing and putting effective risk minimization plan to actions.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/future-of-bank-risk-management/", "title": "The Future of Bank Risk Management | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "In the past decade, there has been a fundamental change in the daily operations of the bank. With completely aiming to transform the operations digitally, the banks especially the private banks have invested a lot in technology to reduce manual labor and to create a more streamlined process. However, this has exposed the banks to unwanted new risks. While banks take a strategic risk aversion strategy to minimize risk, the phases they have been through are restored -> rationalize -> reinvent, they have clearly marked only the first phase of restore through strict regulations and compliances from the regulating bodies both in India and internationally. Making it clear that we are far away from seeing the risk-free banking utopia. Risk management is not the same as risk avoidance. It is about making risk-informed decision to diminish the probability of it affecting the bank. In the long term, it talks about sustained growth. And while processing these risks they must make sure that no new risk is created. History has always been a keen teacher in reflecting our faults. The 2008 financial crisis has been one of the biggest eye-openers for banks. Through its inception, even the Bassel norms in 2012 underwent a huge change pertaining to different banking risks such as the supervision risk, operational risk, and liquidation risk. In the present when we are opening banking to a more digital platform it is more vulnerable to risks both old and new risks. Some of the contemporary risks would include cybersecurity risk and privacy risk. With the digital transformation setting, it is imperative that different banks would undergo disruption to create a unique model or an example to follow. By being the first to adopt the new technologies makes them the first to be exposed to vulnerability. To gain more attraction for customers banks are trying to highlight their easy to use services accessible from home. When it comes to banks the future is a double-edged sword. After all, the banks are involved in the nitty-gritty and the economy of the system, failure of which can reduce the nation into rubbles. For banks, this means a certain level of changes needs to be made into the system such as: Banks have only just started to realize the problems arising from these new risks. While they are trying to minimize problems pertaining to a cyber security risk, credit risk, and operations risk, they have yet to realize other kinds of risks that are influenced by external factors and directly or indirectly harm the bank management system. Prominent amongst these are the geopolitical and socio-political risk that arises due to the global penetration of banks in different cultures and countries without trying to adapt to the local situations. They might seem trivial, but the macroeconomic conditions guided by politics and regulations in a new emerging market can make or break the bank. The near future seems direr. With any bank coming with the prospectus of being in the game for indefinite years, they are more at risk with a potentially long-term effect on customer acquisition and customer service, two vital features in today’s banking prerogative for tomorrow’s banking. With upcoming technologies like the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence or human factors like population growth and mass migration, the long-term risk will be huge enough to outweigh the short gains got from managing short term risks. These may be caused due to reputational risk or conduct risk which as a non-metric risk is not quantifiable but are totally dependent on how banks portray themselves. Over the years, banks have been provided with several regulations to create failsafe measures to avoid these risks. However, as banks advance and are trying to get more competitive, it has become imperative that the risks also differs. Banks must become more cautious and adopt new practical methods different from their rudimentary ways to counter them. A good risk management system is one that can support the bank’s abilities to react to short term risk all the while circumventing itself from long term risk that may occur sooner or later. Such efficiency is important because it can devise new operations and talent models to better cover risk without doing irredeemable damage. But it’s not just the system that needs to be efficient but the role professional plays is equally important. There is a need to have better decision-making capabilities that balance the gains with the losses incurred. All in all, a good risk management technique is one that can sense the disruption in technology and can adapt itself in a reliable system to minimize damage both in the short term and in the long term.

The only mediums of information were books, newspapers, and word of mouth, etc. But now with the advent of the internet and improvements to computer technology (Moore’s Law), information and data skyrocketed, and it has become this open-system, where information can be distributed to people without any kind of limits. Various publicly available tools have taken the rocket science out of encrypting (and decrypting) email and files. Data encryption isn’t just for technology geeks; modern tools make it possible for anyone to encrypt emails and other information. “Encryption used to be the sole province of geeks and mathematicians, but a lot has changed in recent years. In particular, various publicly available tools have taken the rocket science out of encrypting (and decrypting) email and files. GPG for Mail, for example, is an open-source plug-in for the Apple Mail program that makes it easy to encrypt, decrypt, sign and verify emails using the OpenPGP standard. And for protecting files, newer versions of Apple’s OS X operating system come with FileVault, a program that encrypts the hard drive of a computer. Those running Microsoft Windows have a similar program. This software will scramble your data, but won’t protect you from government authorities demanding your encryption key under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (2000), which is why some aficionados recommend TrueCrypt, a program with some very interesting facilities, which might have been useful to David Miranda,” explains John Naughton in an article for The Guardian. One of the most basic, yet often overlooked, data protection tips is backing up your data. Basically, this creates a duplicate copy of your data so that if a device is lost, stolen, or compromised, you don’t also lose your important information. As the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and insurance company Nationwide points out, “According to Nationwide, 68% of small businesses don’t have a disaster recovery plan. The problem with this is the longer it takes you to restore your data, the more money you’ll lose. Gartner found that this downtime can cost companies as much as $300,000 an hour.”  While you should use sound security practices when you’re making use of the cloud, it can provide an ideal solution for backing up your data. Since data is not stored on a local device, it’s easily accessible even when your hardware becomes compromised. “Cloud storage, where data is kept offsite by a provider, is a guarantee of adequate disaster recovery,” according to this post on TechRadar. Twitter: @techradar Scammers are sneaky: sometimes malware is cleverly disguised as an email from a friend or a useful website. Malware is a serious issue plaguing many computer users, and it’s known for cropping up in inconspicuous places, unbeknownst to users. Anti-malware protection is essential for laying a foundation of security for your devices. “Malware (short for malicious software) is software designed to infiltrate or damage a computer without your consent. Malware includes computer viruses, worms, trojan horses, spyware, scareware, and more. It can be present on websites and emails or hidden in downloadable files, photos, videos, freeware, or shareware. (However, it should be noted that most websites, shareware, or freeware applications do not come with malware.) The best way to avoid getting infected is to run a good anti-virus protection program, do periodic scans for spyware, avoid clicking on suspicious email links or websites. But scammers are sneaky: sometimes malware is cleverly disguised as an email from a friend or a useful website. Even the most cautious of web-surfers will likely pick up an infection at some point.,” explains Clark Howard. Twitter: @ClarkHoward Much information can be gleaned through old computing devices, but you can protect your personal data by making hard drives unreadable before disposing of them. “Make old computers’ hard drives unreadable. After you back up your data and transfer the files elsewhere, you should sanitize by disk shredding, magnetically cleaning the disk, or using software to wipe the disk clean. Destroy old computer disks and backup tapes,” according to the Florida Office of the Attorney General. Twitter: @AGPamBondi Operating system updates are a gigantic pain for users; it’s the honest truth. But they’re a necessary evil, as these updates contain critical security patches that will protect your computer from recently discovered threats. Failing to install these updates means your computer is at risk. “No matter which operating system you use, it’s important that you update it regularly. Windows operating systems are typically updated at least monthly, typically on so-called ‘Patch Tuesday.’ Other operating systems may not be updated quite as frequently or on a regular schedule. It’s best to set your operating system to update automatically. The method for doing so will vary depending upon your particular operating system,” says PrivacyRights.org. Twitter: @PrivacyToday Many software programs will automatically connect and update to defend against known risks. In order to ensure that you’re downloading the latest security updates from operating systems and other software, enable automatic updates. “Many software programs will automatically connect and update to defend against known risks. Turn on automatic updates if that’s an available option,” suggests StaySafeOnline.org. Twitter: @StaySafeOnline A valuable tip for both small business owners and individuals or families, it’s always recommended to secure your wireless network with a password. This prevents unauthorized individuals within proximity to hijack your wireless network. Even if they’re merely attempting to get free Wi-Fi access, you don’t want to inadvertently share private information with other people who are using your network without permission. “If you have a Wi-Fi network for your workplace, make sure it is secure, encrypted, and hidden. To hide your Wi-Fi network, set up your wireless access point or router so it does not broadcast the network name, known as the Service Set Identifier (SSID). Password protect access to the router,” says FCC.gov in an article offering data protection tips for small businesses. Twitter: @FCC When you’re finished using your computer or laptop, power it off. Leaving computing devices on, and most often, connected to the Internet, opens the door for rogue attacks. “Leaving your computer connected to the Internet when it’s not in use gives scammers 24/7 access to install malware and commit cybercrimes. To be safe, turn off your computer when it’s not in use,” suggests CSID, a division of Experian. Twitter: @ExperianPS_NA Firewalls assist in blocking dangerous programs, viruses, or spyware before they infiltrate your system.”Firewalls assist in blocking dangerous programs, viruses, or spyware before they infiltrate your system. Various software companies offer firewall protection, but hardware-based firewalls, like those frequently built into network routers, provide a better level of security,” says Geek Squad. Twitter: @GeekSquad Indiana University Information Technology recommends following the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP): “Do not log into a computer with administrator rights unless you must do so to perform specific tasks. Running your computer as an administrator (or as a Power User in Windows) leaves your computer vulnerable to security risks and exploits. Simply visiting an unfamiliar Internet site with these high-privilege accounts can cause extreme damage to your computer, such as reformatting your hard drive, deleting all your files, and creating a new user account with administrative access. When you do need to perform tasks as an administrator, always follow security procedures.” Twitter: @IndianaUniv What’s the difference? “…we recommend you use passphrases–a series of random words or a sentence. The more characters your passphrase has, the stronger it is.  The advantage is these are much easier to remember and type, but still hard for cyber attackers to hack.” explains SANS. Twitter: @SANSAwareness Encrypt your SIM card in case your phone is ever stolen, or take it out if you are selling your old cell phone. Encrypting your data on your removable storage devices can make it more difficult (albeit not impossible) for criminals to interpret your personal data should your device become lost or stolen. USB drives and SIM cards are excellent examples of removable storage devices that can simply be plugged into another device, enabling the user to access all the data stored on it. Unless, of course, it’s encrypted. “Your USB drive could easily be stolen and put into another computer, where they can steal all of your files and even install malware or viruses onto your flash drive that will infect any computer it is plugged in to. Encrypt your SIM card in case your phone is ever stolen, or take it out if you are selling your old cell phone,” according to Mike Juba in an article on Business2Community. Twitter: @EZSolutionCorp A Post-It note stuck to the outside of your laptop or tablet is “akin to leaving your keys in your car,” says The Ohio State University’s Office of the Chief Information Officer. Likewise, you shouldn’t leave your laptop in your car. It’s a magnet for identity thieves. Twitter: @OhioState If you don’t really need your files to be visible to other machines, disable file and media sharing completely. If you have a home wireless network with multiple devices connected, you might find it convenient to share files between machines. However, there’s no reason to make files publicly available if it’s not necessary. “Make sure that you share some of your folders only on the home network. If you don’t really need your files to be visible to other machines, disable file and media sharing completely,” says Kaspersky. Twitter: @kaspersky HowToGeek offers a series of articles with tips, tricks, and tools for encrypting files or sets of files using various programs and tools. This article covers a method for creating an encrypted volume to easily transport private, sensitive data for access on multiple computers. Twitter: @howtogeeksite Deleting your information on a computing device rarely means it’s truly deleted permanently. Often, this data still exists on disk and can be recovered by someone who knows what they’re doing (such as, say, a savvy criminal determined to find your personal information). The only way to really ensure that your old data is gone forever is to overwrite it. Luckily, there are tools to streamline this process. PCWorld covers a tool and process for overwriting old data on Windows operating systems. Twitter: @pcworld If you back up your files to the cloud, remember that even though you delete them on your computer or mobile device, they’re still stored in your cloud account. If you’re diligent about backing up your data and use a secure cloud storage service to do so, you’re headed in the right direction. That said, cloud backups, and any data backups really, create an added step when it comes to deleting old information. Don’t forget to delete files from your backup services in addition to those you remove (or overwrite) on your local devices. “If you back up your files to the cloud, remember that even though you delete them on your computer or mobile device, they’re still stored in your cloud account. To completely delete the file, you’ll also need to remove it from your backup cloud account,” says re/code.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/etl-pipeline/", "title": "ETL Pipeline | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "An ETL Pipeline refers to a set of processes extracting data from an input source, transforming the data, and loading into an output destination such as a database, data mart, or a data warehouse for reporting, analysis, and data synchronization. Extract, Transform, and Load. First, data has to be extracted from various sources that are usually heterogeneous such as business systems, APIs, sensor data, marketing tools, and transaction databases, among others. As you can see, some of these data types are likely to be the structured outputs of widely used systems, while others are semi-structured JSON server logs. The second step consists of transforming the data into a format that can be can be used by different applications. This could mean a change from the format the data is stored into the format needed by the application that will use the data. Successful extraction converts data into a single format for standardized processing. There are a number of tools that can assist with the ETL process, such as DataStage, Informatica, or SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS). Finally, the information which is now available in a consistent format gets loaded. From now one you can obtain any specific piece of data and compare it in relation to any other pieces of data. Data warehouses can either be automatically updated or manually triggered. How these steps are performed varies widely between warehouses based on requirements. Typically, however, data is temporarily stored in at least one set of staging tables as part of the process. Furthermore, the data pipeline doesn’t have to end when the data gets loaded to a database or a data warehouse; it can also trigger business processes by setting off webhooks on other systems ETL is currently evolving so it is able to support integration across transactional systems, operational data stores, BI platforms, MDM hubs, the cloud, and Hadoop platforms. The process of data transformation is made far more complex because of the astonishing growth in the amount of unstructured data. For example, modern data processes often include real-time data -such as web analytics data from very large e-commerce websites. As Hadoop is almost synonymous with big data, several Hadoop-based tools have been developed to handle different aspects of the ETL process. The tools you can use vary depending on how the data is structured, in batches or if you are dealing with streams of data. As a result, you’ll either be working with a combination of Sqoop and MapReduce, or Flume and Spark.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/rise-of-electric-vehicle-and-its-impact-on-livelihood-by-the-year-2040/", "title": "Rise of electric vehicle and its impact on livelihood by the year 2040. | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "Additionally, the electrification of other forms of road transportation continues to increase. Around 25% of all two-wheelers on the road around the globe are electric, however, this trend is mostly restricted to China, India, and ASEAN nations. The world’s worst air quality is in India. Even during the Covid crisis in 2020, when there were national and state lockdowns, 36 of the 50 cities with bad air quality were in India. Internal combustion engines (ICE), in particular, have greatly worsened vehicular pollution as a result of the growing number of private automobiles on Indian roads. India is now the third-highest oil consumer and GHG emitter in the world due to the rise in the stock of ICE automobiles. To prevent it electrification of cars and other vehicles is a must. According to a number of studies, impediments to EV adoption may arise from the distinctions between EV and ICE features. According to surveys, one of the major obstacles to EV adoption’s rapid growth is the vehicles’ limited driving range. Long battery recharge times and a lack of charging infrastructure also have an impact on demand. Longer EV driving ranges, quick recharge periods, and an expansion of the charging infrastructure, however, may eventually result in less significant problems. However, EV popularity is mostly driven by features like high environmental friendliness, quick acceleration, and cheaper maintenance and fuel expenses. China, a pioneer in the production of lithium-ion batteries, is gaining from the increase in interest in EV battery packs. By establishing the ambitious target of having enough batteries available to fulfill its own demand by 2024, the European Union is making an effort to catch up. Plans from several countries The prediction predicts that by 2030, the annual lithium-ion battery consumption for EVs would surpass 1,748-gigawatt hours (GWh).  By 2025, the manufacture of battery cells will have reached 1 trillion watt hours (TWh), according to the capacity projections that have been currently stated. Starting with the surroundings. Depending on the assessment, the automobile industry is thought to produce between 10 and 25 percent of the world’s carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter emissions. These contaminants, which are presently concentrated in the Earth’s atmosphere at their greatest levels in the past 650,000 years, are all related to climate change.  By the end of this century, according to studies, the Earth’s temperature is likely to increase by much more than two degrees Celsius unless considerable changes are made to the world’s industry, energy supply, and consumer habits. These pollutants also caused local pollution and smog, which harmed public health and congested big cities. It was thus no coincidence that automakers started offering alternatively powered vehicles that generated reduced emissions by combining internal combustion engines with electric motors just as the widespread public uproar in reaction to this trend started to grow.  With the introduction of the hybrid Prius in Japan in 1997, Toyota was the first to truly seize this market. In general, there are 4 types of Electric vehicles in the market i.e.Hybrid electric vehicles, Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, All-Electric vehicles, and conventional vehicles. Charging an electric vehicle is always less expensive than purchasing petrol for a conventional vehicle. There is no need for gasoline, saving you money on petrol. The cost of $0.10 per kW is the same as paying less than $1 per gallon of petrol to drive. Driving electric vehicles saves drivers, on average, $700 in gasoline expenditures per year. since they don’t release toxins, they are environmentally beneficial. More than 177,758,804 kg of CO2 emissions have been cut by electric car drivers. fewer repairs because of an effective electric motor. You save on running costs since electric motors have fewer components and cause less damage than conventional, non-electric vehicles. Greater Efficiency, In addition to being lighter, electric vehicles also accelerate more quickly. The best electric car ever made is the Tesla Model 3 with 20″ Überturbine Wheels, Performance Brakes and Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive are available for complete control in all weather. The Model 3 can accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour (mph) in as little as 3.1 seconds because of a carbon fiber spoiler that increases stability at high speeds. In order to increase redundancy, the Tesla All-Wheel Drive incorporates two separate motors, each of which has just one moving element for optimal longevity and low maintenance. They digitally manage torque to the front and back wheels, unlike conventional all-wheel drive systems, providing far superior handling and traction control. A fantastic approach to save money and support a stable and healthy environment is to drive an electric vehicle like the Nissan Leaf, Ford Focus Electric, Tesla Model S, or Chevrolet Volt. Due to the large number of carbon emissions produced by cars, which are released into the atmosphere, we are more susceptible to pollution and greenhouse gases. The ecology is greatly improved by using electric vehicles. Additionally, since electric vehicles have no environmental effect, they are good for the environment and the economy. There are many elements, but that doesn’t mean they have to be overpowering. You can make an informed choice going ahead by doing a good deal of study on various models, including hybrids. Any way you look at it, an electric vehicle can protect our fragile ecosystem.

AI today is much more mundane and simple—but that doesn’t mean it’s not powerful. Another misconception is that high-profile research projects can be applied directly to any business situation. AI done right can create an extreme return on investments (ROIs)—for instance through automation or precise prediction. But it does take thought, time, and proper implementation. We have seen that success and value generated by AI projects are increased when there is a grounded understanding and expectation of what the technology can deliver from the C-suite down. “Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a science and a set of computational technologies that are inspired by—but typically operate quite differently from—the ways people use their nervous systems and bodies to sense, learn, reason and take action.”3 Lately there has been a big rise in the day-to-day use of machines powered by AI. These machines are wired using cross-disciplinary approaches based on mathematics, computer science, statistics, psychology, and more.4 Virtual assistants are becoming more common, most of the web shops predict your purchases, many companies make use of chatbots in their customer service and many companies use algorithms to detect fraud. AI and Deep Learning technology employed in office entry systems will bring proper time tracking of each employee. As this system tries to learn each person with an image processing technology whose data is feed forwarded to a deep learning model where Deep learning isn’t an algorithm per se, but rather a family of algorithms that implements deep networks (many layers). These networks are so deep that new methods of computation, such as graphics processing units (GPUs), are required to train them, in addition to clusters of compute nodes. So using deep learning we can take detect the employee using face and person recognition scan and through which login, logout timing is recorded. Using an AI system we can even identify each employee’s entry time, their working hours, non-working hours by tracking the movement of an employee in the office so that system can predict and report HR for the salary for each employee based on their working hours. Our system can take feed from CCTV to track movements of employees and this system is capable of recognizing a person even he/she is being masked as in this pandemic situation by taking their iris scan. With this system installed inside the office, the following are some of the benefits: For several countries, regulations insist that the employer must keep documents available that can demonstrate the working hours performed by each employee. In the event of control from the labor inspectorate or a dispute with an employee, the employer must be able to explain and justify the working hours for the company. This can be made easy as our system is tracking employee movements This is about monitoring user connection times to detect suspicious access times. In the event where compromised credentials are used to log on at 3 a.m. on a Saturday, a notification on this access could alert the IT team that an attack is possibly underway. To manage and react to employees’ attendance, overtime thresholds, productivity, and suspicious access times, our system records and stores detailed and interactive reporting on users’ connection times. These records allow you to better manage users’ connection times and provide accurate, detailed data required by management. 4)If you want to avoid paying overtime, make sure that your employees respect certain working time quotas or even avoid suspicious access. Our system will alert the HR officer about each employee’s office in and out time so that they can accordingly take action. 5)Last but not least it reduces human resource needs to keep track of the records and sending the report to HR and HR officials has to check through the report so this system will reduce times and human resource needs With the use of AI and Deep Learning technologies, we can automate some routines stuff with more functionality which humans need more resources to keep track thereby reducing time spent on manual data entry works rather companies can think of making their position high in the competitive world.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/impacts-of-covid-19-on-streets-sides-food-stalls/", "title": "Impacts of COVID 19 on Streets Sides Food Stalls | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "Petty Entrepreneurs like Streetside Food Stalls form an essential part of an economy that plays a significant role in balancing the development of a nation’s economy. The importance of street food vendors not only helps in increasing the country’s per capita income but also helps to make a living for the unemployed in society with a limited investment. Most of them are the sole breadwinners for their families. So, with the Covid-19 wreaking havoc, the uncertainty of the lockdown policies increased the concern of people over hygiene and the lack of investment to upgrade their businesses to provide better hygiene facilities that can take away food from their mouths.  Various states have provided relief packages and support but, in a country, as populous as ours, it has hardly been appropriately implemented. Delhi, for instance, recently announced a rupee 500 million stimulus package to nearly 500,000 rupees, recognizing the severe consequences of the loss of livelihoods. The seller’s intended remedy is a credit loan that provides all sellers with an initial working capital of Rs 10,000, but this is not enough. Instead of loans, the government should consider converting them directly into income benefits, cash subsidies to secure a livelihood in order to initiate income-generating activities on a regular basis. Sellers need income support to get back to work, and if they can’t, they will never be able to repay the loan amount. In an ever-changing crisis, organizations need to take a step forward and ensure that providers are provided with the resources they need to make a living. Pandemics have had a vast economic impact on every sector, but the most vulnerable sectors, such as street vendors, suffer the most. Decreased income can affect most necessities, such as payments to family and yourself. Due to a lack of fixed salaries, stalls cannot quit their jobs. If possible, it might be only a few days, unlike regular employees. For them, the risk of infection is far less frightening than hunger. Unlike many of the businesses, most of these food vendors lack the infrastructure to go online and sell products through platforms like Swiggy or Zomato.  says Dilip Das, a Street side food stall owner at Sector V, Kolkata. Dilip Das used to run a small streetside food stall that provided meals to all the employees around the area which is filled with multinational companies. It was a booming business till the arrival of Covid. Then with the lockdown arriving, almost all the companies opted for Work from Home policies. Dilip tried to start deliveries, but with a lack of support and fear of infection, that business ended before it even started. Citing similar reasons, Swapan Mondal, who runs a south Indian food stall at Park Street said that he did know how to operate a smartphone. And since sales were good, he did not care about learning either. But with the implementation of lockdown which took place within 4 hours, people like Swapan barely had time to cope with the changes. Furthermore, the Covid 19 pandemic made people realize how important trains are in our life. With most of the train network suspended, the entire supply chain was disrupted. Hundreds of quintals of food products rotted away, awaiting the logistical issues to fix. Many businesses could not afford to run without proper supplies as well. To handle such issues, vendors organizations may consider the following solutions: The impact of COVID19 was extremely severe for informal workers who ran out of capital and income and to try to feed themselves during this long embargo. Sellers need to be able to resume sales in order to survive, and governments need to take steps to reopen the market and bring sellers back to the business. India has different types of traditionally crowded markets, even weekly markets (fresh food, cooked food, and essentials) and daily roadside markets. These markets have to reopen with the need for social distance in mind, and the government needs to publish guidelines for that. In the future, sales areas will also need to be designed with social distance and the need for adequate sanitation (running water, wash areas, toilets) in mind. Authorities need to work with the Town Bending Commission (TVC). Once the restrictions are lifted and the impact of Covid 19 is somewhat manageable, sellers who have been at home for months will need direct income benefits to help them to return to work. The government initiative is a welcome move, but not in terms of the type of bailout and eligibility is enough. In addition, there are very few registered providers in India, so government relief and support must be separated from the very strict registration requirements. In Delhi alone,  of the approximately 300,000 street vendors, only approximately 13100 have some sort of professional ID. If all types of cash grants or livelihood support standards relate to job identification by the state,  the government must also accept registration with workers’ organizations/unions on behalf of government-issued sales badges. The government and municipal corporations need to take the initiative and running water, and soap/sanitizers need to be provided for street vendors at their place of work. Moreover, the streetside food vendors should work with food safety authorities in the country to train themselves in different ways to maintain hygiene whilst working. Many small businessmen and food vendors do not even know their rights and the benefits they can claim. If they did, many still have no idea about how to claim them. Proper awareness camps need to be set up to help these small-time food vendors to know how they can get assistance and help from the government and return back to the business. When Covid was an unknown word, these shopkeepers and vendors brought the taste to our mouth, gave us memories to live for, filled our bellies, and quenched our thirst when we needed them. It’s time to provide them with a hand now when they need it.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/advanced-analytics-redefining-banking/", "title": "How advanced analytics are redefining banking? | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "The banking industry is going through a transformational journey with the comprehensive usage of Advanced Analytics algorithms in day to day business of core banking. Customer acquisition through various channels, existing customer engagement, predicting defaulters on credit card or loan applications, etc are few of the areas where analytics is doing a tremendous job. I will explain some scenarios from my past experience of working in the advanced analytics team of a leading multinational bank where we had used some interesting concepts from analytics and machine learning to solve complex business problems. It is impossible to track God, but you can track your potential customers with the help of advanced analytics algorithms. A lot of information about their buying patterns, demographics, transactions, service requests, etc are available with banks. This is being used efficiently to predict the propensity of a customer buying a specific product. While working in the analytics department, I collaborated with many sales teams which needed a rank-ordered list of potential future customers for direct mailer/cold calling campaigns. The campaigns usually contain an attractive offer specific to the product, like lower interest rate for a credit card, higher interest on savings account, etc. which are hedged by confidence that the significant number of customers from the ranked list would be up for buying the product, as opposed to the ones being contacted randomly. Not only potential customers for a product, but also which customers are having the mindset to close their account (Customer Attrition) is being predicted. Data science algorithms such as Logistic Regression work well in predicting the probability of customer propensity to buy or customer attrition probability. For example, consider the below real-life business problem: A leading MNC bank wants to formulate a strategy to curb the\ncustomer attrition, which is constantly on the rise, for their Savings Account\nproduct. They reach out to the Advanced Analytics department to help them in\nretaining their best customers by predicting which one of them is having a\npropensity towards closing their account so that they can connect with them and\noffer attractive offers to continue their invaluable relationship. The Advanced Analytics team starts with first narrowing down\nthe problem and defining Attrition, for eg- customers taking out their parked\nmoney, closing their Savings Account, and not reinvesting their money with\nanother product offered by the same bank. The business wants to predict\nattrition 3 months in advance to get sufficient time to design a retention\nstrategy. The team then moves on to collect the required data, which usually takes up most of the time in the project as questions like which data to collect, for how much time period, what additional data is needed, etc. are very critical requirements. Once the stage is set, the Data Scientists perform their final act – Machine Learning. The algorithms will read the data and find out patterns leading to attrition behavior based on previous account closures. It will then leverage this learning on newly available customer information in the current scenario and predicts the probability of attrition. I came across an astounding project predicting customer propensity to buy retail banking products 10 years from today! Guess what was the driving feature in these algorithms? That’s right, current educational background and achievements tracked on business social media websites lead to understanding where the person would want to park their money in the future. One very interesting use of Natural Language Processing algorithms like Naïve Bayes classifier in retail banking is into analyzing transactions. Each transaction is associated with a code and a short description. Data scientists use language parsing to extract keywords or tokens from the humongous text generated to read through the description and discover more about the transaction. It can be identified whether you have paid for a product at a retail store, transferred money to another bank account that you hold or paid the bill of a credit card from another bank. The transactions can be then linked to how you value your current relationship with the bank and the business can decide upon various customer outreach strategies based on this critical information. According to the laws of economics, choices spoil us. The more the options in front of customers, the more confused they become and the more chances of not buying the product. A very niche field that makes use of hardcore machine learning algorithms is Targeted Digital Marketing, and retail banking is constantly using this to identify and catch potential customers visiting the website by displaying customized web content which caters to the needs of visitors and offer products they are looking for. How does the business know what the customer wants? Digital Footprints! Millions of website visitors generate thousands of GBs of data that contain information such as what channel they come from, which is the most frequent landing page on the bank’s website, which pages they scan through, how much time they spend reading the content, how many unique visits they make per day or week etc. This data is called the Digital Footprint of a website visitor, also called Clickstream Data. Banking and financial institutions have been churning this data to generate accurate information about what exactly the visitor is looking for, and they efficiently display customized content to the visitors with products that they would be interested in displayed on the home page. This prompts the visitor to click on the display link and understand more about the product, as the saying goes, they buy what they see. You should not display too much content altogether as it will confuse the visitor and they might log off without making any deal, or without leaving their information to be contacted later. The information from digital footprints can be customized to the extent of what % rate the visitor would convert on! Customized content is displayed based on which current visitors show characteristics of other visitors in the past who got converted. Since the conversion rate is minimal as only a few out of millions of visitors on the bank’s website actually buy a product or service online, we need to use some very powerful machine learning algorithms that can catch the pattern with the limited amount of data to learn on. Also, there is a huge amount of data that needs to be read through by the algorithm as digital footprints get generated with each second. Machine Learning algorithms such as Random Forest (which use Bagging methodology) or Gradient Boosting (which use Boosting methodology) come to the rescue. These algorithms are efficient in handling huge amount of data and can identify patterns with good accuracy. Data Scientists also use a technique called Stacking where outputs of different algorithms are combined and fed into another model to calculate probability as a combination of various machine learning algorithms. So, the next time you visit a bank’s website and pop-up displays offering an attractive interest rate on the home loan, be assured that a heavily loaded machine learning algorithm running in the background has monitored your activity on the website and knows what you are looking for.  Majority of decision making in Banks and Financial\nInstitutions is done by dividing things into groups that have similar\ncharacteristics and behave in a particular way, so that decisions may be\napplied in batches which saves time, energy and of course money. Clustering\nalgorithms to the rescue! I cannot count the number of times we proposed clusters\nas a solution to a business problem but would share two instances I distinctly\nremember where we did so. The first one was for a bank which wanted to identify its most loyal customers from, well, not so loyal. Our approach was to define loyalty based on three metrics: recency of transactions, frequency of transactions and the monetary value of transactions (better known as RFM model in analytics world). These three metrics combined, with a certain weight assigned to each one based on what is more important to the business, enable us to rank which customers are interacting more as compared to others (who eventually are dormant and fall in not so loyal category). An important consideration is to study the transactions in depth otherwise errors might creep in. For instance, and this is very interesting, when we developed the categories based on RFM score, we saw every single savings account holder scored very high on recency value. This was very intriguing for us and we spent days in identifying what was happening, only to later realize that every savings account has an interest receivable by the account holder, and it credits to the account at the end of each month. The trade-offs of being too technical I suppose. The second instance was when the business wanted to identify bank branches that have lower than average performance, on metrics like new customers acquired, average balances maintained in accounts, quality of home loan applications sent to head branch for approval, promoter score of customers, employee attrition, etc. Using k-means clustering, we identified and differentiated all the high performing branches on these metrics from the lower ones. This helped the bank in taking decisions like reviewing the financial targets for lower performing branches or provide focus on employee training, and also incentivize the high performing branches to inspire others. The core idea behind all advanced analytics and data science algorithms is to help the business make better decisions faster. They say data is the new oil, and analytics is the process of converting oil to fuel.

While this fact is good news for the automobile industry, it is also bad news for the environment. How? Well, India is also the 3rd largest oil-consuming and Green House Gas (GHG) emitting nation. According to the Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), during the 2020 lockdown, even though the complete economy was shut yet 36 out of 50 big cities in India had unhealthy air quality. Taking into account the current situation where according to studies, vehicles annually contribute about 290 Giga grams of PM2, at the same time, around 8 percent of total GHG (Green House Gas) Emissions in India are from the transport sector and in Delhi, it exceeds 30 percent and also in the account of the promises made by India on decreasing Carbon emissions NITI Ayog wants to electrify India’s 2W segment by 2025 and the 3W segment by 2030. India has aimed to create 100 percent Electric Vehicle (EV) use by 2030. While experts say that this goal is quite ambitious and a hybrid of both Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Internal Combustion Engines (ICEs) may be seen in India for another decade but India is ushering itself towards its   So basically, since the war between Ukraine and Russia seems to be never-ending and Russia is an exporter of crude petroleum to the world, the rates of petroleum in the International market are skyrocketing and India is the 3rd largest oil-consuming nation and 90 percent of this oil is being imported, a lot of India’s money is being driven towards that which needs to be controlled.  Moreover, after the lockdown people are trying to stay at distance from each other and thus the people who can afford are trying to use personal vehicles instead of public ones. This is why India is on its way to becoming the largest market for automobiles, given the population.  The effect of rising oil prices (touching the 100rs mark now and then) can be seen in other products as well, transportation costs increasing inflation of course.  Therefore the government is hoping to control our import bills with EVs (Electric Vehicles) and Hydrogen Running Vehicles. But (no matter what is being said, there’s always a but in India) here’s a catch if the hasty push is being done then that may further increase our country’s import bill. How? Well, currently most of the EV components are imported from China, yet nothing much to worry about, huge Indian Automobile Industries are trying to make EVs (Electric Vehicles) completely made in India, you just need to be informed and smart consumer.  Now let’s see what the government is doing about the issue currently:  Since battery costs 70 percent of the total manufacturing cost of an EV (Electrical Vehicle), MoRTH (Ministry of Road Transport and Highways) is considering ‘Battery as a service business model.  The government has allotted a budget of about 100 crores in its latest budget.  The government is working on applying the Fame II Policy wherein it will spend 86 percent on Consumer Incentives and 10 percent on Charging Infrastructure.  The government is trying to attract FDIs and take help with the import of Li (Lithium) to make batteries.  The government has also promised to build charging infrastructure.  The government has also launched an e-portal that is e-amrit.niti.gov on COP26 Summit in Glasgow. The portal gives an insight into the major benefits of using EVs (Electric Vehicles). The major benefits talked about are:  Zero Tailpipe Emission (ZTE)  Lower Running Cost  Lower Maintenance  Less Tax  Environmental Benefits  Easy to Drive  Quite You might feel that the government is adamant about its “ICE to EV by 2030” mission, yet let’s talk about what government can add to this mission.  The double Dividend Hypothesis by David Pearce in 1991 states that environmental taxation can improve economic and environmental conditions and recycling revenues obtained to reduce other pre-existing taxes.  Norway provides no toll and free parking to people using EVs as an incentive.  Sweden and France give tax levitation to people using EVs. Now let’s chitchat a bit upon the problems that consumers think might come if they switch to EVs:  Short driving range of EVs  Long Battery Recharge Time  Lack of charging Infrastructure  Higher cost  Battery life  High cost of commercial electricity  Poor roads If India is looking forward to an EV future then it has to build a good road network because it is proven that carbon emission by ICE is lesser on good roads and the driving range of EVs is also greater on good roads. Now let’s talk about how will this affect livelihood in the future that is by 2040. So let me give you some of my and some of the expert’s predictions to conclude this article :  According to Crew Report demand for power is expected to rise by 80 percent.  About 75 percent of vehicles will be EVs.  This will usher in the use of Railways for large distances.  Let’s not forget air transport as well.  Transportation cost of goods to decrease  Imports to decrease in large amounts.  Empty petrol stations (better if converted to charging stations)  And me writing and you reading about self-solarized EVs. The last one was obvious (chuckles) but since you have read me so far, allow me to share a small, additional yet important information that will be summarized by my last prediction. So, there is this EV trade route that happens to have the Philippines, Japan, and the US. And here The Philippines extracts Ni (Nickel) for batteries of EVs from Rio Tuba, a mine, Japan purifies it and The US makes batteries out of them and uses them in EVs. Now since demand is increasing, the mining of Rio Tuba is increasing too which is affecting the Rainforests of the Philippines and its ecosystem, making us question “Is it even a solution?”  And here I predict:  High prices and nonavailability of batteries and their parts in the world.

This layer contains user profile data, item data, behavior data, and comment data. The user profile data may be users’ heights and weights, items they purchased, their purchase preferences, or their educational background. The item data is the prices, colors, and origins of items. The behavior data refers to the interaction between users and items. For example, when a user watches a video, the user may add alike to the video, add the video to favorites, or pay for the video. These actions are all the user’s behavior data. The comment data may involve third-party data, and may not be available for every item on every platform. However, the user data, the item data, and the behavior data are essential. With the three types of data ready, we can move on to the data processing and storage layer. In this layer, we can perform data processing, such as identifying user features, material features, and event features. Going forward is modeling based on these features. The entire recommendation process contains two important modules: matching and ranking. Multiple algorithms can run in parallel in the matching module. Matching is followed by ranking. Many ranking algorithms are also available. Next, you need to develop a new policy. You must filter and deduplicate the recommendation results, perform A/B tests on the results, and try the operational strategies before you push the recommendations online. For example, if you bought a Xiaomi phone shortly after you saw the recommendation for Xiaomi phones yesterday, it is definitely inappropriate for me to recommend Xiaomi phones again today. The top layer is the recommendation service, which can recommend an advertisement, a product, or a user. For example, a social networking app can recommend users to let them follow each other. When you have such a recommendation architecture, some cloud services will be needed to make the architecture meet the four basic requirements on an enterprise-level recommender system. The most common practice is to build these modules based on cloud services and cloud ecosystems We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/impacts-of-covid-19-on-vegetable-vendors/", "title": "Impacts of COVID 19 on Vegetable Vendors | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "The   pandemic has grown into one of the most major and socially disruptive   crises in recent memory, with growing worried about how the pandemic’s catastrophic  and social repercussions are affecting food systems at both the global and local levels. Given the importance of the retail food environment in establishing and sustaining healthy diets, interruptions to specific aspects of it, such as the availability of fresh vegetables, could have a negative influence on population health, which has already been noted as a source of worry. Despite the dominance of national and international supermarket chains, warehouse clubs, and supercenters in grocery  , vegetables are offered in a number of other food retail settings. Fresh vegetable #vendors are typically smaller and more community-oriented than other restaurant or retail food outlets and can include chain or independent grocery stores, greengrocers, storefront stands, street carts, and even makeshift platforms dedicated to the sale of fresh vegetables. Smaller community fresh vegetable vendors who may conduct business on the sides of major streets or on storefronts have played an integral role in the food environment in large urban centers such as New York City (NYC), particularly in ethnic enclaves, despite the fact that fresh produce does not have a significantly higher nutritional value and fresh produce can also be purchased at these larger food retailers. Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, many fresh fruit and vegetable vendors, notably street carts selling fresh vegetables in cities across the United States, including New York City, have been forced to close owing to a combination of falling demand and fear of catching COVID-19. The importance of fresh vegetable vendors varies by neighborhood within cities. Furthermore, these fresh vegetable vendors attract visitors and interborough shoppers from a variety of cultural backgrounds not only Asian ones who are looking for things that are not available elsewhere in the city or for the same low prices. These fresh vegetable vendors, unlike larger, well-established grocery store vendors, may not have the financial infrastructure to sustain the shifts in  and  produced by the COVID-19 epidemic; consequently, the danger of closure or modifications in services may be greater for these vendors. In order to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on   offered by fresh vegetable vendors, surveillance #data from both before and after the pandemic’s inception is required. After a few days, vegetable dealers began venturing out without explicit permission and were quickly harassed by police. After a few weeks, the government relaxed the limitations, allowing vital traders to sell their wares (due in large part to the advocacy of vendor organizations and activist networks). However, the cost of doing business has increased dramatically, as vendors no longer have access to wholesale markets and suppliers, and they must spend more on travel expenditures owing to city-imposed travel limitations. Furthermore, with the partial lockdown still in place, the number of buyers has decreased, as have earnings. Perishable vegetables have a shorter shelf life in the summer heat, thus vendors are unable to capitalize on whatever produce they do have. Consider the situation of Delhi at the starting of COVID 19. The state has launched an INR 5000 crore stimulus package for over 50 lakh vendors, realizing the serious consequences of their loss of livelihood. The targeted relief for vendors is a credit facility that will provide all sellers with an initial working capital of INR 10,000, but this will not be enough. Instead of credit, the government should consider changing it into a direct income benefit, such as a cash grant, to help people start earning money on a regular basis. The vendors require income support in order to resume work, and how will they repay the loan if they are unable to do so? Vendor organizations must step forth in the face of the ever-changing crises and lobby for vendors to be given the resources they need to continue their livelihoods. Vendor organizations could use the following as part of their advocacy agenda: Finally, some fresh vegetable sellers may have shuttered for a period of time early in the epidemic, only to reopen recently. Alternatively, vendors may have launched soon after the in-person checks were completed, but still within the June-July 2020 endpoint timeframe. This is a drawback of the method; in order to offer the most reliable COVID-19 pandemic monitoring data, data must be collected in a short period of time.

It converts these documents into machine coded text.  In order to get it more closer to 100%, requires a lot of tuning and training. There is a lot of pre-processing work involved before the most accurate information could be retrieved.  There are a couple of open-source frameworks that can be used to build an OCR framework in house. They are effective too as long as you know how to train it for your requirements. Listed below are a couple of such frameworks. PyOCR( ) is an optical character recognition (OCR) tool wrapper for python. That is, it helps using OCR tools from a Python program.It has been tested only on GNU/Linux systems. It should also work on similar systems (*BSD, etc). It may or may not work on Windows, MacOSX, etc. PyOCR can be used as a wrapper for google’s   or Cuneiform. It can read all image types supported by  , including jpeg, png, gif, bmp, tiff, and others. It also supports bounding box data. Tesseract is an optical character recognition engine for various operating systems.It is free software released under the Apache License, Version 2.0, and was originally developed at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories Bristol and at Hewlett-Packard Co, Greeley Colorado between 1985 and 1994, with some more changes made in 1996 to port to Windows, and some C++izing in 1998. In 2005 Tesseract was open sourced by HP. It was later developed and sponsored by Google since 2006. Tesseract is considered as one of the most accurate open-source OCR engines currently available. There were not many open source options for being able to build on your own. In this document, we will be do a deep dive into the Tesseract framework and how to have it setup and how good or bad would the outcomes be. Most OCR frameworks out there is probably built on top of Tesseract and it is the most popular among the bunch which has pretty good outcomes. Tesseract supports a whole slew of languages like no other framework. It supports English, Spanish, Thai all the way upto Tamil, Uzbec and Yiddish. It will be hard to find something that is not supported.  is one of the most popular API’s available and it gets you the most accurate information. Vision API is more of an image processing framework than just an optical character recognition framework. If the intention is to just identify what characters are present in the image, this framework has a lot more to it. This framework is really expensive unless your base set of images are a few. Below is the pricing information. ( ) is again an image processing framework just like the Google’s Vision API.This framework uses deep learning technology to identify objects, image and faces. This is little less expensive than Vision API. Below is the pricing information. ( ) is a more of a budget friendly option compared to the first 2 options. This SDK does a neat job of getting the needed information but not to the level of Rekognition and Vision APIs. If your requirement is less than 25K request a month you can even get away for free.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/blockchain-in-fintech/", "title": "Blockchain in Fintech | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "Blockchain or the Distributed Ledger Technology has\nalready been around for some time now. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, based on\nthe Blockchain technology, are making entry into the formal finance world and\nincreasingly becoming a medium for exchange. Though there are many potential\nuse cases for Cryptocurrencies and the Indian Government is very critical about\nimplementing the technology in banking and finance, it still has a lot of\nissues to be resolved before we can commercially use it for transactions.  Some of the most important drawbacks of\nCryptocurrencies like Bitcoin right now are as below: So, it becomes important to have a cheaply available\nvalidation mechanism that can be carried out using a basic broadband connection\nin-home/small business computers. If two people have personal transaction\nhistory, it’s unimportant that it should be posted on the main blockchain every\ntime a transaction takes place as it could bloat up the blockchain. Moreover,\neveryday transactions using cryptocurrency is not possible as the cost of\nposting a transaction for. Let’s say buying a coffee, can be more than the\nprice of coffee itself. Lightning Network is the latest disruptive technology\nbeing researched currently in Fintech to make cryptocurrencies scalable. It\nbasically adds\nan extra layer on top of the main Bitcoin Blockchain and enables payment\nchannels between two parties over this layer. Micropayments for everyday\ntransactions can be very easily carried out using this channel. Here is how it\nworks: Suppose A buys a coffee\nfrom the nearby coffee shop B daily on her way to work. A and B decide to open\na channel on the Blockchain for their everyday transactions. Once the channel\n(or the Lightning Network) is open, the two parties can keep a track of their\ndaily transactions on this ledger. At the end of the month, with the ledger\nreflecting balances left with each party, they decide to close the channel.\nThis final transaction is then recorded on the main Bitcoin Blockchain. This\nreduces the cost of the transaction and enables micropayments for everyday\ntransactions.  Micropayment channels can defer updating the main\nblockchain with remaining balances at a later date. A large network of\nmicropayments can be created as a secondary layer on top of the main blockchain\nto address the scalability issue and reduce transaction fees. Although this solution\nis very much in the initial stages, resolving the scalability issue and\nreducing transaction fees by taking the transaction out of the main blockchain\nwill give a big boost to the use of Cryptocurrencies. The two parties exchange a single key for validation\nof their spend transactions. They can conduct an unlimited number of transactions\non this channel and finally when one party closes the channel, the balances\nwill be added to the blockchain. The network is globally scalable since to reach any\nperson through connected channels network, you just need to know the path to\nconnect to that person through leveraging your existing network. Once the\nnetwork develops in future, the requirement to open a separate channel too\nwould cease to exist since the algorithm will automatically find the shortest\nroute to connect to the person whom you want to pay based on the exhaustive\npeer to peer network. This would ease inter-country transactions and money can\nbe sent across internationally within seconds. Since the channel for Lightning Network is separate and not connected with the main Blockchain, it will not be backed by the security of the original Blockchain. This can be a major concern for its widespread adoption and the companies should research extensively into this. Another challenge is its dependency on the internet. The Lightning Network is not capable of storing coins digitally in a hardware wallet. This makes it prone to hackers since the wallet will be available online. Also, transferring large amounts of money is something that needs further detailed research, since bigger payment might struggle with routing in the network. Nevertheless, this technology is really fascinating and has a very broad usage through the implementation of Bitcoins and Distributed Ledger in everyday life. Once this is rolled out for customer experience, micropayments will be possible between two parties on Blockchain, just as we currently have wallets to transfer money for small purchases. The Lightning Network has a long way to go and is surely going to become the next big disruption in Fintech domain after Blockchain.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/blockchain-for-payments/", "title": "Blockchain for Payments | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "between having a tight budget and being seriously stretched thin for money. Dangerously enough during the second month of my MBA, I was treading on the prospect of the latter. It struck me that I could find my savior in an uncle who lived in San Jose and was the type who always saved for a rainy day. With online payment avowedly ubiquitous and simple, it seemed like a no-brainer to me. One tap on an app and I would be rid of this predicament I had found myself in. Quickly enough, he initiated a fund transfer via Xoom, a PayPal service. I was dismayed to learn it would take all of three days for the money to finally reach me! One would believe that in the era of globalization and high-speed internet payments would be fulfilled in a trice. But contrary to expectations, I learned that most cross-border payments are subject to numerous go-betweens and channels rendering them behindhand especially in some parts of the word. A complex series of interactions involving banks, merchants and other parties underlie the seemingly non-complex act of initiating payment on the user-friendly one quick Interfaces. Anyone who has transferred money between countries recently realizes the process has evolved little in decades. Too slow, untrustworthy and too expensive are the gripes. And as more of us become plugged into the globalized economy, the scale of the problem is surely going to skyrocket. This begs the need for if a 21st-century digital solution to cross-border payments which could be faster, less expensive, more reliable and transparent. Consider the case of Ashok Chandra, a mid-tier textile exporter. His business entails frequent wire-transfers to Dubai and Indonesia. These wire-transfers can take up to 3 days causing Mr. Chandra to worry about delays in addition to working capital constraints. He feels left in the dark regarding the standing of his dealing and out of pocket high fees Such wire-transfers are often a major deterrent to the volume of trade. Small to medium-sized enterprises, above all, suffer from payments difficulties. It may take weeks for a cross-border payment to settle, which may place the brakes on the business’s liquidity, and build friction between customers and suppliers. A McKinsey survey found that global payments looks set to be a $2-trillion industry by 2020, accounting for a third of banking revenues. Nearly 70 percent of mid-sized B2Bs in the U.S. strongly preferred digital channels for payment approval and foreign exchange transactions emphasizing the dire need for efficient and real-time payments. The payments industry is grappling for the backend\nto catch up with the apparent convenience which payments apps seek to provide.\nOver the years, the size of import and export trade between the U.S. and China\nhas burgeoned to more than half a trillion dollars. Presently payment suppliers have to pre-fund accounts on either facet of dealing in native currencies. this may be costly and result in a poor deal for purchasers. Benefitting from favorable exchange rates which come as an added advantage of faster payments is crucial as well. Blockchain is touted as the solution for global business ills by its ardent supporters. The next big disruptive technology in the payment space Blockchain can ease Cross-border payments in several ways. The distributed ledger technology (DLT) that underlies cryptocurrencies is currently being deployed by a few providers as the answer. Roughly seventy percent of prime international banks are experimenting with it, and recently some big implementations are underway The distinctive point of blockchain – that reciprocally distrusting parties, geographically agnostic, will reach a sure agreement electronically is a banker’s dream. For about the same transaction fee and a more competitive forex rate, API-based blockchain platforms can significantly cut down processing time. This can significantly cut-down costs after nearly a century long-stagnant processing fee of traditional banking. Kuangyi Wei, head of research and market engagement at management consultancy Parker Fitzgerald estimates that it can save a third of the current operating costs. Blockchain thus offers a cryptographically secure and trusty platform with high transparency. It further enables the bypassing of typical Forex rates. Small and mid-size firms like that of Mr.Chandra’s can thus reap the benefits of the best rates for their business. Giants like IBM\nare working on designing a universal, cross-country blockchain payments\nsolution that can herald instantaneously inter-bank transfer. This would\nrequire streamlining multiple steps involving multiple stakeholders transacting\nin different currencies. Distributed ledgers are changeless databases area unit maintained by a network of computers, instead of a centralized authority, and secured by advanced cryptography. These are often described and clunky and difficult to maintain. They require enormous computing power to reconcile everything. The matter is further aggravated by the volume of cross-border payments, banks, and jurisdictions. Centralized databases area unit still a lot of\neconomical than blockchains. Over-sold and over-hyped area unit different words\nutilized in this context, managing expectations on what blockchain are able to\ndo are vital. Operational resilience has additionally become a significant issue for central banks and regulators. considerations raised regarding DLT embrace privacy, security, measurability, and competition Only time can tell if Blockchain will eventually become the panacea of payments it is heralded to be.

Are you scared that artificial intelligence will control the world within a couple of years? COVID-19 has revealed how vulnerable the health care industry is to change and its need for structural and technological transformation. The COVID-19 pandemic has been an unwelcome reminder of just how much health matters not only to individuals and society but also to the global economy. Improved health accounted for about one-third of the overall GDP per capita growth of developed economies in the past century.  The traditional boundaries of the industry will dissolve and new roles will emerge in the future of health as exponential innovation propels the industry towards 2040. By 2040, health care as we know it today will no longer exist. There will be a fundamental shift from “health care” to “health.” And while disease will never be eliminated, through science, data, and technology, we can identify it earlier, intervene proactively, and better understand its progression to help consumers more effectively and actively sustain their well-being.  The future will be focused on wellness and managed by companies that assume new roles to drive value in the transformed health ecosystem. As the rate of technological evolution continues to speed up, companies need to look ahead and proactively plan for the future. For the healthcare industry, in particular, this need is even more pressing as it is compounded by the pace of declining health in our society. Ray Hammond commented on what healthcare will look like in 2040:  “Healthcare is one of the few arenas in which every one of us has a stake. The next 20 years will witness a profound change in healthcare, all the more notable given that medical science and healthcare delivery tend to be conservative, slow-moving sectors that are highly resistant to change. The annual global market is currently estimated to be worth around $8.1 trillion, with annual global spending on healthcare forecast to rise to $18.28 trillion by 2040.  With that in mind, we have a collective responsibility to ourselves and to the next generation to determine what that change will look like and the impact it will have on all of us.” How exactly does better health promote economic growth? First, fewer people are likely to die prematurely so the working-age population will increase. When people are healthier, absences from sickness decline and workers are less distracted by managing their  conditions or those of their loved ones. Also, fewer workers retire early because of health conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic has hit people with underlying health conditions hardest—for example, diabetes, hypertension, a chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, and obesity, which are common across most of the world’s economies. We can improve the health of the world’s population, and that would not only build resilience against future pandemics but also dramatically improve the quality of life of millions of people who suffer the heavy daily the toll of chronic conditions. Actions or programs such as adopting healthy behavior, expanding access to primary care, and improving medication adherence—could reduce the global disease burden by 40% over 20 years. We found that such a reduction of the disease burden would deliver tremendous benefits: a 65-year-old in 2040 could be as healthy as a 55-year-old today, infant mortality would decline by 65% and 230 million more people would be alive in 2040. More than 70% of the health benefits would come from prevention through healthier environments, healthier behavior, and preventive care (including safe childbirth, vaccination, and adherence to medications that lower risk) rather than treatment of diseases.  One way to improve health is to invest in communities so that children can grow up to live long and healthy lives as adults. The remaining 30% of the benefits we found would come from proven therapies to treat existing health conditions. “Future health care and wellbeing” report authored by internationally renowned futurologist, Ray Hammond presents the likely future developments and trends in healthcare between now and 2040. Among the report’s key healthcare predictions for 2040 are: • Health information from traditional annual physical check-ups and other tests previously only available in surgery or lab will be replaced by data from sensors on/around our ‘smart’ bodies (including in our clothing and, eventually, skin and blood). This will be immediately accessible to us, in real-time. • A new field of ‘predictive medical data mining’ will provide early warnings of physiological trouble ahead or indications of disease as it develops. Physicians will have 24/7 real-time reports of their patients’ wellbeing and will be alerted to any change in patients’ data that requires urgent attention. • Stem-cell medicine will be a powerful tool in mainstream medicine. For example, replacement human organs for transplant will be grown on demand from stem cells in the lab, with minimal risk of rejection • Nano-medicine (in its infancy in 2019) may eventually outperform all other branches of medical science, as scientists create ‘designer drugs that are far more powerful than today’s drugs • Artificial Intelligence (AI) ‘chatbots’ equipped with deep learning algorithms could relieve emergency room personnel of tending to large numbers of walk-in patients with non-emergencies (e.g. sore throats, UTIs). The 10 archetypes will fall into three distinct, but interconnected, categories: • Data and platforms: These archetypes will be the foundational infrastructure that forms the backbone of tomorrow’s health ecosystem. They will generate insights for decision-making. Everything else will build off of the data and platforms that underpin consumer-driven health. • Well-being and care delivery: These archetypes will be the most health-focused of the three groupings made up of care facilities and health communities—both virtual and physical, and will provide consumer-centric delivery of products, care, wellness, and well-being. • Care enablement: These archetypes will be connectors, financers, and regulators that help make the industry’s “engine” run. All three components need to be fully functioning and integrated for the future of health to come to life. The future of healthcare is shaping up in front of our very eyes with advances in digital healthcare technologies, such as artificial intelligence, VR/AR, 3D printing, robotics, and nanotechnology.  We have to familiarize ourselves with the latest developments to be able to control technology and not the other way around. The future of healthcare lies in working hand-in-hand with technology and healthcare workers have to embrace emerging healthcare technologies to stay relevant in the coming years. So it is worth starting “the future” with the betterment of our health through digital technologies, as well as changing our attitude towards the concept of health as such and towards medicine and healthcare.

The client wanted Blackcoffer to help them with their digital marketing solutions by creating their social media presence, engaging their customers on the social platforms, and increasing the customer experiences by performing social analytics and analyzing the customer sentiments towards their brands and products that they sell. Blackcoffer studied the business cases of the micro-businesses and CASID businesses based in the New Jersey city. The customer experience platform was designed and developed for each of the micro and CASID businesses in the New Jersey city. NLTK’s VADER module was utilized to get the sentiment score for the reviews, comments, and tweets. In the case of tweets, all tweets by the Business’s twitter handle as well as those hash-tagging the business or addressed to the business (#Business and @Business) were included. The sentiment score which was obtained was continuous in the range of -1 to 1 with -1 being most negative and 1 being most positive. It was then segmented into five equal sentiment classes equally spaced from -2 to 2 in order to lump nearby sentiment scores. The final observations have been drawn on both these scores. Furthermore, some of the reviews and tweets were found to have improbable dates such as in the future or long past, and hence they were omitted from the trend analysis.       Blackcoffer delivered the following business impacts: We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/how-ai-will-help-the-defense-power-of-a-country/", "title": "How AI will help the Defense Power of a country? | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "Defense is crucial to a nation’s well-being and progress. For this reason, every country assigns tantamount importance to it. To protect its interests, a nation has to guard its land, seas, and the air (with the addition of space recently with the anti-satellite missile). Just like other sectors, technology has impacted defense as well. Continual improvements are being made in the design of guns, missiles, submarines, ships, planes, and so on. At the same time, efforts are being made to minimize human loss during wars. One of the best ways to do so would be to employ expendable machines that could do the work. The concept that enables machines to do so is  The immediate thing that might come to our mind is a Terminator-like soldier which will completely replace humans. However, that is not even close to reality because of the difficulties involved. At present, AI cannot do that level of multitasking, cannot react to new and difficult situations, and also can be confused by the enemies. Given below is a wonderful article by  However, as the author says, AI can be used in maintenance applications to determine if a system is going to fail or needs repair. A similar kind of application is to analyze the medical condition of a soldier and predict his operability so that he can be treated for it. The best way right now is to enhance the overall power of the armed forces; the machines must act as force multipliers, assist humans, not replace them. This is the objective that countries are presently working to achieve. Let us consider land warfare. Soldiers have to push into the battlefield, face enemy attacks and possibly sustain fatal wounds. Moreover, few terrains are too difficult and dangerous for humans to access. This problem can be reduced considerably using the following technologies:   and  . UGVs come in various sizes from small bag-sized to medium-sized tanks. This is because of the variety of roles they are employed in. The small ones are ideal for reconnaissance purposes, mine detection, bomb disposal, and small assault operations. This is because of their small size which makes them difficult to detect and also enables them to access inaccessible places. India has already developed Daksh for the above purposes. Another notable example is Gladiator UGV in the US. The US is also trying to develop ball robots for the same purposes. Autonomous tanks are useful because they assist the conventional tanks by acting as a security cover while also carrying out assault operations or carrying essential gear. The Milrem UGV is being used by Estonian troops in Mali in Africa for carrying supplies and ammunition. Mostly the technology is still under development but once approved, it will be very useful to a nation. A link with UGV info is given below. Sentry guns are static devices. They have basically powered machine guns that rotate about a fixed point and fire automatically at targets using their cameras and sensors. They are very useful when it comes to the defense of a place from invading enemies. A battery of these guns can be installed at various points around the specified place. Thus sentry guns are extremely useful because they prevent the defending soldiers from becoming exposed targets. South Korea uses this system at the demilitarized zone between North Korea and South Korea. Autonomous technologies can also be applied in water. There are certain operations such as minesweeping or stand-by where there is a high threat to the ships involved. For these, we can use   and  . Autonomous boats are useful because they can protect bigger ships that are standing idle or exposed. They can also carry out reconnaissance and assault operations. The US Navy is currently trying to make such boats operational. Underwater, the submarine is the combat vehicle. In present times, underwater warfare has become more complex due to the adoption of stealth technologies, like acoustic dampening and anti-submarine technologies which can be deployed from the air. This also increases the number of staff on submarines required to handle such situations and increases the threat of significant casualties. However, the use of UUV would significantly reduce these problems and thus countries like the USA, China whose navies are the largest in the world, are trying to incorporate this technology to increase their dominance. AI has been implemented in aerial attacks very successfully in the form of   or   (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle). Almost all countries have implemented this technology. These aircraft are just like remote control planes, only a little bigger. Here AI is used to identify targets on the ground and communicate with the operator. India has Rustom, Netra, Lakshya, and various other drones/UAV’s. However, the US is trying to produce an unmanned fighter jet that can escort manned fighter planes, transport aircraft, and engage in aerial combat. All the above technologies can work either independently or can be operated remotely. When they operate independently, they collect information from the battlefield using sensors, and using AI, it makes decisions. When used remotely, i.e. operated by a person from a different place they behave pretty much like remote control devices. The great advantage of this technology is that human intervention and thus casualty is reduced. Also, the cost of producing such technology is considerably lower than producing manned machines. The most significant use involves ‘swarming’, which is similar to the swarming of bees around an intruder. When deployed in packs, they encircle the enemy and devastate them. Loss of these machines does not cause significant loss; they are expendables, easily replaceable. Warfare has a new front nowadays: Cyber Front. The recent   hack is a clear example for emphasizing this. As the world becomes increasingly digital, nations or entities (can be called terrorists) will look forward to exploiting this to their advantage. Most of these attacks have been done with one objective: extract sensitive and confidential data. Using this data, a country’s money can be stolen, electrical blackouts may be caused or even worse, the country’s defense can be paralyzed for facilitating the foreign attack. Coming to the size of data, it is HUGE (in PB). Processing this kind of volume requires techniques like big data. And to identify weak spots in millions of accounts or networks, hackers might be using AI and ML (Machine learning). Just like them, cybersecurity officials have to use AI or ML to predict and simulate cyber-attacks and identify weak spots in cybersecurity.  Now it comes down to who uses better technology and techniques. AI has to counter AI. However, there is a concern that applies to all sectors using AI: Will AI replace humans? Will it rule us? The answer is yes if we use too much AI. The same applies in the defense sector also. The applications that have been discussed here act as force multipliers as long as humans control them. AI should never replace soldiers, but perform tasks that are too risky or impossible for humans. AI should not be allowed to become too intelligent nor they should be allowed to operate independently. Machine learning should be confined only to familiarize with battlefield situations, not to think ahead of us and act arbitrarily. Before such a device fires a bullet on its own, a human must be there to see that it happens according to his will. Another concern is hacking. What if the enemy hacks these devices? Such concerns must be addressed by adding multiple layers of encryption or limiting the amount of communication possible. Take, for example, a regular ‘nonsmart’ washing machine. We cannot communicate with it in any other way other than pressing its buttons. Nor can it do anything else other than washing clothes. This could be done with all the unmanned vehicles. Communication must be restricted to the user and the machine. The device should perform only its intended duty. If a nation learns to harness and balance the use of technology, then not only its defense sector but also all the other sectors will be stronger and ensure the nation’s holistic development.

Most of the forecasting is driven by guestimates. Nowadays, analytics is playing a great role in demand forecasting. Other important pillars of the supply chain such as procurement, distribution, planning, etc are also being driven by analytics in order to minimize the cost and improve the efficiency of the whole value chain. Fashion e-tailers get benefited from big data and analytics in order to develop markets in developing countries. There is a glut of data present in the industry which needs to be structured to be used and make sense of. When e-tailers need to enter a new market, there is a need to have a strategy and a business plan. It becomes easy to form a strategy and business plan for entering in developing countries by crunching the numbers available in the form of big data and applying advanced analytical techniques. Big data and analytics is still at the beginning stages of the development at many companies and will take time to build out. Time for real-time supply chain practices has come and is on the verge of being more mainstream. The top consulting firm utilizes advanced predictive analytics to predict and reduce lead times as well as inventory. One of the biggest challenges is maintaining the accuracy of the data on which various complex algorithms are being applied. There is an increasing interest in the areas of improved forecasting and Sales & Operations Planning. The supply chain is the backbone of any company and plays a prominent role in the company’s cost structure and profitability. The growing tsunami of data is a boon to businesses in the digital age. Limitless oceans of data, often reflecting customer experience as it happens, have the potential to remake supply chains. To put data growth in context: the world’s total digital data volume, which is doubling every two years, stood at 4.4 zettabytes (trillion gigabytes) in 2013 and is projected to reach 44 zettabytes by 2020. (EY, 2016) With such amount of data generated it is imperative for the player in the industry to understand and utilize this opportunity. Analytics, be it descriptive, prescriptive or predictive has become an integral part of the industry. Diagnostic analytics are used for root cause analysis (RCA), online analytical processing (OLAP), and what-if analytics. They have commonly applied for RCA of supply chain performance and data visualization. Prescriptive analytics allows optimization of transportation routes, factory scheduling, and inventory. (Masters, 2016) Predictive analytics and machine learning provide a platform to make utilize it to make decisions. Different time-series stochastic models are being built to analyze customer preferences and forecast sales and other parameters to plan for the everchanging demand. Financial data, demand data, product data, manufacturing data, inventory data, weather, traffic, track and trace data, etc. are inputs for prescriptive analytics which helps in answering the questions such as: What will be the effects of decision or situation? How can an organization make a particular target to happen? Prescriptive analytics help to predict scenarios at very minute levels of details. It helps to predict the effect of shifting to a new supplier on product quality or even it can help to decide whether the introduction of the new autonomous machine would increase safety on the warehouse floor or not. Markets can be developed by implementing analytics on the abundant data present in developing countries. This helps in cost-effectiveness as more sense can be made about business and a new market with the help of existing data and new techniques. In conclusion, analytics and big data in fashion e-tailer industry can be a game changer for any organization because of its ability to provide a major competitive advantage over others. Data is growing exponentially and analytics provides a tool for the industry to organize it and make sense of the emerging patterns that come up. Analytics in conjunction with other technologies is shifting the way industry operates and bringing in real-time solutions to ease the pressure and reduce the operations expenditure. It is the need of the hour and we are seeing its presence and the effect it brings to the fashion e-tailer industry.   \n \n We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/data-harmonization-etl-data-cleansing-classifications/", "title": "Data Harmonization, ETL, Data Cleansing, & Classifications | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "In this “what we do” chapter, we explain one of the most important solutions for your business and various data-related challenges. We are giving step by step details of data harmonization, and not only that, what are the critical components of data harmonization and how it can be archived to solve your business problem and how it can be deployed at the production level. You have multiple regions, platforms, campaigns, and creative and each piece of the marketing puzzle produces its own trove of data. You want to understand your marketing performance across these lines to make smarter decisions, but in its original systems, this data is siloed. Even if you bring the data together through straightforward API connections, without unifying your data types or and getting your naming conventions standardized, your data will still be sitting in disparate buckets. Side-by-side reporting is no more useful than analysis in the original tools themselves. In order to understand the customer journey which is inherently seamless, you need to be able to see outliers, trends, and the cause and effect across data sets. This means you need to bring all your data together in one platform, and link up fields where they are similar like “campaign name” or “country”. For a true view of your customers, budgets, and campaigns, you need to harmonize your data. Data harmonization is the process of bringing together your data of varying file formats, naming conventions, and columns, and transforming it into one cohesive data set. Marketing data is inherently siloed for example, Google AdWords and Salesforce aren’t necessarily using the same technology or even terminology to run their platforms. On top of this, marketing is a team sport with many team members and partners running your campaigns, website, and CRM in concert. At scale, it’s pretty common that not everyone uses the same terminology in their systems to describe your regions, products, and campaigns. Blackcoffer’s approach consists of hosting a centralized “out-of-the-box” data model where any new fields can be mapped and organized guided by machine learning that understands your marketing data (often this step happens automatically). This harmonization turns all of your disparate data into the “apple to apples” format you need for analysis. Extract, transform and load is three database operations responsible for actually moving your data into a common database. Extraction reads the data in the original database, transformation changes the format so it’s ready for querying and analysis, while loading writes the data to your destination database. Traditionally, this can be the most issue-prone part of data integration, because an error in one step causes inaccurate or missing data throughout. And each system comes with its own set of unique types of problems it can have. That’s why the right technology is so important in the ETL process, so you can focus less on micromanaging the movement of data and have more time to spend on analysis and decision making. Data centralization is the process of getting your marketing data in one centralized location. ETL is used to get the data all in one place. But, there are many marketing dashboard tools that can centralize data via APIs. To harmonize your data, your platform will need to have a data model that blends your data together.  Data cleansing is the act of correcting or moving inaccurate, broken, or erroneous data from your dataset. Think of this as giving your data a makeover. If you’ve ever corrected misspelled or mashed together field names in a spreadsheet, congrats! You’ve cleansed data. Data normalization and harmonization can be used interchangeably. Both imply making the fundamental aspects of your data all the same. Classifications are the field names in your data, or in the simplest terms, they’re the titles at the top of our columns in a table. From a business perspective, these are what help you segment your data, filter it and drill in or zoom out (e.g., from a global view of a campaign down to a specific city). The naming conventions used to describe your data can (surprisingly) vary greatly across your marketing tools and teams– even when referring to the same concepts. If your data is not harmonized, you’re restricted to looking at your sources of data separately and that’s counterintuitive to the reality of modern marketing. Marketing campaigns span channels, devices, and personas. The platforms where customer data is collected are wide-ranging, changing, and certain tools get replaced every day. DataIntel was built to solve the modern marketer’s dilemma, with a marketing-friendly data integrations (ETL), a centralized data model and machine learning-powered harmonization to make this process as easy as possible. Data harmonization used to be an exhaustive, time-consuming process of data wrangling and custom coding. But it should be a seamless part of the analytics process, so marketers can focus on finding the insights that drive their business forward and acting on them.

A critical requirement was to keep the application source code private, as the client intended to sell the AI solutions without exposing the underlying code. Using cloud infrastructure (like AWS or GCP) was not a viable option due to high GPU costs and the early stage of the AI systems. Moreover, the applications were tightly coupled with hardcoded configurations (e.g., `localhost` backends), causing integration issues when tested across different environments.   A Blackcoffer DevOps engineer collaborated with the client to Dockerize all AI systems, allowing them to be deployed easily on edge devices without requiring access to the source code. This ensured full code protection and simplified deployments across different machines. We tested and validated each Docker container on client-provided GPU-enabled machines (AI3, AI5, AI7, AI8, AI9), ensuring: This approach allowed the client to confidently test and showcase their AI products, while preserving code confidentiality and avoiding unnecessary cloud expenses during development. 🧠 Face Recognition System: 🔁 Flow Description (Right to Left): 🧠 Indoor Counting System:  🔁 Flow Description (Right to Left)         Challenge: Ensuring reliable GPU passthrough on varied client hardware.   Solution:   Challenge: No AWS/GCP deployment due to high GPU cost and early development stage.   Solution:   Challenge: Source code confidentiality was critical.   Solution:   Challenge: Each AI module (Event Analysis, Indoor Counting, Face Recognition) had different frameworks, libraries, and model formats.   Solution:   Challenge: Cross-system compatibility and permission issues with mounted folders like `/mnt/share`.   Solution:     By avoiding cloud platforms like AWS or GCP (which have high GPU rental costs), the client was able to dramatically reduce development and testing expenses by using their own edge machines (AI3–AI9). The client was able to demonstrate and test their AI systems without ever exposing source code, preserving the commercial value of their proprietary models and algorithms. With Dockerized AI systems and documented manual deployment workflows, the client can now roll out new builds quickly and consistently across any number of edge devices without reconfiguring environments. The project output included production-grade, containerized binaries that the client can distribute, sell, or demo to stakeholders confidently—without any dependency on developer environments. Uniform container behavior and dynamic configuration replaced hardcoded setups, resulting in more reliable and realistic testing scenarios on different hardware and environments. With internal logs, GPU verification scripts, and deployment documentation provided, the client’s internal team is now empowered to deploy and troubleshoot systems independently, reducing reliance on the engineering team.

So our task was to device a solution through which all the data from Auvik and Connectwise can be fed to Grafana. This data then would be used to plot graphs in Grafana. Grafana Postgres Vs Code AWS Postman Python bash Python networking Data visualisation Postgres Amazon Web Services (AWS) Since, the data received from Auvik was in Json fromat, our first approach was to use Grafana’s built-in Json plugin. But this wasn’t working since, the data received from Auvik was multi-dimensional when the Json plugin required One dimensional data.  The above challenge was addressed by transforming the multi- dimensional data into one dimensional when it was store in a python variable. This transformed data was then inserted into Postgres.

Because then only he would be able to predict and manipulate our future based on our actions. I am not an atheist; it’s just that I couldn’t find a better metaphor to depict the power of analytics. Analytics is a way of interpreting and communicating relevant and meaningful patterns in data. Thus, it is obvious that for the existence of analytics, it requires data. Now, the good news is that data is everywhere; every single human impression, online or offline, is data. But, the bad news is that it is extremely difficult to filter out the relevant information from the ocean of data. Well, for a relief, analytics is getting evolved to take care of this issue as well. The answer of the evolved analytics, to the issue of finding relevant data, is   (embedded in Artificial Intelligence). In simple words, if you are searching for particular information, let’s say about a word Adam which could be anything, a name, any brand, a restaurant or whatsoever; Web 3.0 will analyze your location, your interests through your impressions on the internet and on the basis of them, it will show the results for the word “Adam” that are most relevant to you. The companies, these days, find the positioning of their products and brands the most crucial and challenging task. With a myriad of similar brands, with similar offerings, it is really difficult to make a dominant impression on the minds of the consumers. After, digital platforms coming into the picture, the power has passed into the hands of the consumers. From the selection of delivery channels, selection of communication channels to the selection of payment methods, every component in the distribution channel is an offering bundled with the actual product/service. Thus, companies are leveraging the attributes of the distribution channels as the point of differentiation to stand out in the horde of brands. In order to control and optimize these attributes, the brands are trying to decipher the behavior of the consumers and their preferences by critically analyzing their on-site and in-store buying patterns. This need of the marketers has led to the introduction of what we call the Age of Analytics. So, let us look at some great and unique ways in which Analytics has helped the firms to accurately analyze and predict consumer buying behavior. Let us design this recipe of success by fragmenting Analytics into its different kinds, and then explaining the role of each fragment in designing the business plan for any firm. So, depending upon the field of analysis and the objective of analysis, Analytics can be largely fragmented into predictive analytics, prescriptive analytics, descriptive analytics, retail analytics, store assortment, and stock-keeping unit optimization, marketing optimization and marketing mix modeling, web analytics. Now, let us look at the different stages involved in the designing of a business plan for any firm and the right kind of analytics to be applied for that particular stage. It is important to analyze the industry in which the firm is operating. One cannot compare the sales of a geo-textile manufacturing company with a company that manufactures biscuits. Thus analyzing the industry standards is the first and foremost step towards developing a successful business plan. For this stage, the firm needs   tools which can interpret the past data of the industry into meaningful patterns and trends which are easier to study. Also, the industry standards must be converted into measurable terms so as to define a reference point for the firm. Before entering into the battleground, a firm must be aware of its own strengths and weaknesses. Weakness is a term that can transform the fate of a firm. A company which is aware of what not to do is better than a company which knows what to do. The   will again come into the play but in a different context. Now, the approach will company-centric. This will include determining the infrastructural and customer service capabilities of the firm and the external opportunities and threats to the firm from the data obtained through primary and secondary research techniques. The center of every business plan is the consumer. Thus, understanding their needs and preferences becomes an urgent requirement for the business plan. The answer to this urgency is  . Predictive analytics takes the past buying behavior and buying a pattern of the consumers as the input for the analysis. The key tasks are to predict the perceived value of the offerings in the minds of consumers, the consumer involvement with the product and the factors influencing the consumers’ buying behavior. From the industry analysis only, one can draw a rough idea about the best performing firms in the industry and a bit about their positioning strategies. But this is not enough. Determining the secret ingredient of their recipe is the key motive of conducting competitors’ analysis. The task is difficult. Thus it requires a synergy of descriptive as well as predictive analytics. With the help of the trends and patterns designed through descriptive analytics, the firm has to predict the key competencies, the target segment, and the promotion strategies of its competitors. After doing the complete background check of the industry, the competitors, and the company itself, it is time to act. The action plan has to be comprehensive, feasible, measurable, and well directed towards the goal of the company.  serves the purpose of this stage. The results from the past analyses will serve as the input data for this stage. In this stage, the firm will make strategies for market optimization, brand assortment, stock keeping unit optimization, marketing mix modeling and communication channel strategy. Implementation is a crucial phase. A company implements a strategy at a large level may be national or at times at the global level. Thus, to track the data becomes the most challenging task in this phase. Now, why is the data so important? Well, a business cycle never ends; incremental development is the key to survival in the market. Thus, to measure the success of the strategy, to accurately predict the consumer behavior for future strategies, for retaining the consumers through post-purchase strategies, a company must manage its data very wisely. In the planning phase, the well-directed objectives were set, and the decisions were made with assigned parameters (or KPIs) to measure the success of the plan. In the implementation phase, a large amount of data is collected representing the actual reaction of the consumers towards the company’s strategy. Now, in the measurement phase, the actual reaction of the consumers will be put against the expected reaction. For managing such a large quantity of data,  is the solution. After the measurement phase, the company will have a clear picture of what went wrong and what went right. This will build the base of the company’s future strategies. Analytics has made things simpler and complex at the same times. On one side, where analytics provides simple solutions for designing a better business plan, at the same time it is making the competitions more intense and competitors more unpredictable. In the end, the things that have always created a difference are intuition and self-belief, and Analytics is meant just to provide a basis for those beliefs and inner feelings. ***   \n \n We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

In the RAD model, there is less attention paid to the planning and more priority is given to the development tasks. It targets developing software in a short span of time. ● Advantages of RAD Model: o Changing requirements can be accommodated. o Progress can be measured. o Iteration time can be short with the use of powerful RAD tools. o Productivity with fewer people in a short time. o Reduced development time. o Increases reusability of components. o Quick initial reviews occur. o Encourages customer feedback. o Integration from the very beginning solves a lot of integration issues ● API Data Abstraction ● Data Mining and Statistical Modelling ● Data Wrangling ● Deployment for Automation ● Data Visualization ● SQL ● Machine Learning ● Python Programming including OOPs and Exception Handling ● Google Firestore (Just for Testing Purpose) ● Google BigQuery Google BigQuery Cloud Database with up to 1 TB of free storage is being used.  ● Scheduling Automation of Python Script. ● Data Exceptions and Duplication in BigQuery Tables. ● Refresh token Expiration After 7 Days. ● Data Exception due to Inactive companies or not Updation of LSA Main sheet.  ● Basecamp ProjectId Issue for transferring Data to multiple companies projects. ● Data Studio Time Series Plot data mismatch due to multiple account id. ● Scheduling Automation of Python Script. Python Library BlockingScheduler were used and the Timezone variable ‘TZ’ was set to Los Angeles in Heroku ● Data Exceptions and Duplication in BigQuery Tables.        Structuring SQL Query to deal with all the database issues which were being used in BigQuery to solve those issues. ● Refresh token Expiration after 7 Days. Initially ‘Auth Playground’ was used for generating Refresh token which was getting expired after every 7 Days so to last it longer for more than a year we are now using the refresh token which was generated using Python script where proper token endpoints and many other headers were defined before generating the refresh token. ● Data Exception due to Inactive companies or not Updation of LSA Main sheet.  Data Exception occurred while API data abstraction for few of the companies which were solved by adding more nested try and except statements after understanding issues also ‘LSA Clients Lead’ main sheet was not being updated by other members due to which we missed out data for few of the companies which were solved by creating script which will automatically update the mainsheet when an error occurred. ● Basecamp ProjectId Issue for transferring Data to multiple companies projects. This issue was solved by creating Basecamp Main sheet where data was fetched now by mapping the account id of fetched data using LSA Main sheet and project id of all the basecamp companies. ● Data Studio Time Series Plot data mismatch due to multiple account id. Solved by adding many parameters like setting the metrics which will do a summation of all the companies on a particular day for all the account id.

In addition to this, all of the backend javascript also needed to be changed in order to query the new elasticsearch database. The client’s website was a visualization tool. It also had GUI to add filters. To make the visualizations, at least 50,000 records needed to be pulled from the Postgres database whose size would be around 200mbs. This would take a lot of time (nearly 20-30 secs). Adding filters would take additional time. So our task was to move the entire database over to Elasticsearch from postgres since it is way more faster in search operations and also filtering data. Since the database was changed, we also had to write new backend code that would now query the Elasticsearch database. Elasticsearch Postman Kibana Logstash Python Javascript Amazon Web Services Postgres Docker Git Bucket Github Javascript Json Domain-Specific Language for elasticsearch bash Elasticsearch query knowledge Postgres query knowledge Networking Javascript Backend web stack Postgres Elasticsearch Amazon Web Services (AWS) To solve the above mentioned problem, we used gzip in the request url’s header.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/big-data-and-analytics-to-help-form-political-leaders-win-election/", "title": "Big Data and Analytics to Help form Political Leaders Win Election | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "The above quote by Winston Churchill highlights the fact that politics is not made for the light-hearted or those who are in it for fun. It is not a dreamers’ palace but a pit where rivals fight it out to succeed. In recent times, technology has completely changed how political leaders compete. The presence of multiple platforms, microbloggers, and hundreds of social media websites has changed the dynamics of the pit completely. Data analytics was a buzzword during Barack Obama’s election campaigns in 2008 and 2012. It is also believed that predictive models and extensive analysis of the data of US citizens helped him turn the tides in his favor in 2012. US elections post 2012 saw a decrease in traditional advertising expenditure from 93% to less than 50%. These elections also saw a man with no political experience take the reins of the most powerful country in the world. Cambridge Analytica (infamously known for harvesting data from Facebook) was awarded the research-focused, ARF Ogilvy awards in the following year and the dependence of the world on data analytics was reiterated. Elections are not just campaigns based on sentiments, hunches, and popular opinions; instead, influencers and digital trends lead the way in swaying masses to favor an electoral candidate. Big data is considered to be empowering for political leaders. When a political leader decides to contest an election; he has terabytes of data on what opinion people have of him, what is expected of the next leader, how many people might vote for him, and most importantly what are the most pressing concerns in the society. Extensive data mining and collecting data after every event has given political leaders an opportunity to adopt a modular approach and voice a different concern to different people. This has reduced the number of misfires significantly. Through analytics, political leaders and their research teams have been able to categorize the entire population on the basis of psychographic segmentation. These segmentations have enabled political leaders to include personalized and tailor-made strategies to be more closely affiliated with people. Every word that a political leader says is backed by algorithms which makes the delivery impeccable. This unparalleled precision is what draws political leaders to adopt data-based campaigns. Social media content is now being altered accordingly as well. People with similar political interests would find similar content on social media. This content would be coherent to their interests which ensures that the user is bound to read it. When a common man is checking his notifications for early morning updates, he is being targeted by the research team of a political campaign without him realizing it. Campaigns have limited financial resources. When the resources are limited, information such as the amount of contact required for a particular constituency and which population to target can help in the effective utilization of resources. A political leader can recognize constituencies that could swing either way or the ones which are a lost cause and effectively manage resources to produce favorable results. Analytics firms collect huge amounts of data. Algorithms are used which reveal trends, opinions, and other patterns that would have required door-to-door campaigning a few decades ago. This data also includes an analysis of social media websites. The firm uses this data to predict outcomes based on the coherency of opinions of the people with that of a political leader. The task at hand for the political leader now would be to convert more people in his favor. Data will give reports of the constituencies where the vote might swing in either way. The leader capitalizes on these areas. Micro-targeting potential voters were widely used during Obama’s campaign of 2012. This included specific TV advertisements and tailor-made social media messages to influence people. These customized campaigns have helped many leaders and their use is becoming more prominent. While on one side everything seems bright; the use of big data raises some serious concerns as well. One of the biggest concerns that have been raised is the issue of data privacy. Accurate analysis requires huge volumes of good quality data. It is claimed that most of the data gathered are through primary research (surveys, polls, etc.). Primary research has its limitations and there is always a risk of data being highly skewed. It has been accused that most of the data usually being gathered is secondary research data under the guise of primary data.  Cambridge Analytica was accused of using personal data of American citizens through Facebook while it was working for state senator Ted Cruz. Scandals like these raise serious concerns about the misuse of ones’ data by political leaders. Data manipulation is another concern that has affected elections. Accusations were made on Russian hackers for manipulating US presidential elections by accessing research data and private emails of electoral candidates. Though these are just accusations it does not deny the fact that it might be a possibility in the future. While data has empowered political leaders, it is on them on how they choose to utilize this information. A leader can choose to hide his personal opinions and intended agendas just to maintain consistency with the masses or intentionally design a manifesto which portrays him as the most ideal candidate. Amplification of malpractices which the authorities might not be able to detect in due time is a serious concern. While data is enlightening, statistical use of human preferences and equating human lives to pointers being justified is certainly food for thought. Big data and analytics is a double-edged sword whose effectiveness will continue to bring more political leaders towards it and for now, the bonus of using it appropriately remains with the leaders, but the incentive to misuse it is fairly high. \n     We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

For Project ‘Population and Community Survey of America’ task involved fetching json and unformatted csv data from numerous web links further needed to process data, handling nested JSON, data conversion of JSON data in dataframe, performing certain pandas operation for feature selection and structuring data. Concat all this data into one csv file then handle missing value by mapping with another dataset finally perform certain data visualization and exploratory data analysis. Module 1: Data Abstraction The process of data abstraction involves collecting data from numerous web links from Year 2005 to 2017 and viewing the data using JSON viewer in tree format. Module 2: Data Chunking and Integration Was unable to process data in pandas so performed data chunking with chunksize 10000 rows at a time for year 2005 likewise performed for all other years data till 2017 and finally combined all the dataframes into one containing all data from year 2005 to 2017. Module 3: Handling Complexity of Nested Data & format the Unformatted CSV Files Handling unformatted CSV in proper comma separated format so that data frame can be formed. Dataframe produced after merging for all the years from 2005 to 2017 contains a lot of nested JSON data among certain attributes so performed normalization of nested Json forming new_columns naming them based on their attributes key. 2.2.4 Module 4: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Involves handling missing value, contraction mapping with another dataset to fill the missing State_Zip_Code column, handling inf and -inf within the dataset for some attributes and forming a new column population_ratio based on passing formula among other attributes. 2.2.5 Module 5: Data Analysis This step involves forming a correlation matrix to understand the relation between numeric attributes. performed Exploratory Data Analysis on strong correlated attributes to understand pattern/relation between them.  After completion of Project we provided: ● Jupyter Notebook ● Anaconda ● Notepad++ ● Sublime Text ● Brackets ● Python 3.4 ● JSON Viewer ● Python ● ETL Techniques ● Advanced Excel Formatting  My project ‘Population and Community Survey of America’ developed with a software model which makes the project high quality, reliable and cost effective. ● Software Model : RAD(Rapid Application Development model) Model ● This Project follows a RAD Model as our model is not forming the loop from end to the start, also my project was based on prototyping without any specific planning. In the RAD model, there is less attention paid to the planning and more priority is given to the development tasks. It targets developing software in a short span of time. ● Advantages of RAD Model: o Changing requirements can be accommodated. o Progress can be measured. o Iteration time can be short with use of powerful RAD tools. o Productivity with fewer people in a short time. o Reduced development time. o Increases reusability of components. o Quick initial reviews occur. o Encourages customer feedback. o Integration from very beginning solves a lot of integration issues No Database is used in this project, only used Google Drive for Storing and Transferring Data. No Web Server is Used Data Cleaning and Filling out Missing Values by Data mapping with another dataset as the Data was not in proper format in the another dataset. Data Cleaning was done using a few built in pandas operations to deal with Missing Values, Ordering Data Columns, Data Formatting, Changing of data types and many more. Filling of remaining Missing Data from columns using Outer Join among the datasets and using Map Function of Python.       figure 3 is pandas dataset of year 2008 which has 169595 rows and 25 columns which was fetched from authenticated survey web portal, data obtained were in JSON format which were converted into pandas dataframe likewise there are dataframes created from year 2005 to 2017. figure 4 is an output preprocessed dataset from 2005 to 2017 which has 26,41,363 rows and 25 columns. figure 6 represents the bar plot among the state_name on the final output dataset from year 2005 till 2017. figure 7 represents the Kernel Density Estimate Plot(KDE) among all Population estimate data columns for the Preprocessed Dataset. KDE plot is a method for visualizing the distribution of observations in a dataset, analogous to a histogram. KDE represents the data using a continuous probability density curve in one or more dimensions. Plotted many more graphs apart this between highly correlated attributes like pair plot, box plot, line plot etc.    We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

Companies also struggle with how to connect with their customers in a highly personalized yet efficient way. Hierro is a new two-sided conversation platform that creates trusted connections using secure digital identities. It gives everyone an effortless way to interact over unique, private connections that you control. The client was struggling with a solution to  over the phone which is generally a time-consuming process, impersonal, and aggravating. Including a solution for organizations, where organizations also suffer from connecting with their customers in a highly personalized and efficient way. HearRo partnered with Blackcoffer to design, and implement a   that creates trusted connections using secure digital identities including an effortless way to interact over unique, private connections that customers and organizations can control. The repository https://github.com/vijayst/twilio-chat-with-flex is built with a dummy demo server. This is not an exact API but used as a reference solution. On the server end # port 4000, generate token and create channel are two functionalities. The token is generated and then a channel(Chat-Message) is created. On the client end # port 3000, a front-end layer(chat window) is created and any message that is posted here goes to the server and then reaches the Twilio chat client. A token is created at Twilio which is necessary to create a channel… Both the server and client, we have Index.Js and create-channel.Js though only one channel is created. At the server end, Index.Js calls the generate token and creates a token. Using this token and FlexFlowId, then a channel is created using the create channel by logging into “https://preview.twilio.com/Flex/FlexFlows“. There are several validations while creating a channel like whether it is a web channel, the identity is valid and if it is a registered web channel. If everything is validated, the web channel is opened using the “https://preview.twilio.com/Flex/WebChannels”. After opening the web channel, it opens up on the server page. At the client end, Index.Js calls the App Component which in turn opens up the chat window, which is an HTML page client. There are several functions like handle submit event handler handleMessageChange and handleKeyPress to handle the input messages. The same token and flexid (from the server) are invoked here to create the same channel created by the server. Basically, the messages pass from the client (to server) to Twilio and backward. CreateChannel, SetChannel, and set Messages are called in the client to pass the messages to the server. Server/Index.js Server/Createchannel.js Server/GenerateaccessToken.js Client/App.js Client/createChannel.js These are the top five scripts to be analyzed. A post asynchronous method is used to fetch the token and a post asynchronous method is used to create the channel. Both these are called from Index.js script. The is posted with an environmental variable SID token and the response is stored in JSON and fetched back from Twilio. The import Axios module is critical here. Using the token created in the above script we log into  with the credentials SID and Token, a validation is done if it is a web channel. FlexSid is fetched from this process after validating it. Using this FlexSID, identity, and FlexChannel login and Token we create the web channel, and chat_channel_sid is stored as a response in JSON. A chat window is created at the client end with a message and message input window. The following functions are invoked in case of corresponding events from the message window on the Left of the expression. After submitting the Message window is restored to an empty box. When the enter key is pressed, the message is captured. useEffect and state Hooks are used to handle the states and coordinate with the effect. Three different states where null,’ ‘  and []are handled as below. Function message is used to classify the author by its sent or received by means of a ternary operation. Messages are stored in an array which is sliced and a new message is un-shifted, i.e. moved back to position1 Twilio client is imported. The server is called. Using the client display name, the client is created from the server by the client. create a function with the response. token in the server-side script(JSON format) The server is called by identity and display name. Chat client is created by chatclient.getSid for which response.data is passed. In fact, it is the same channel created in the server which is called in the client. On top of this is the originally built solution with Dynamo-DB/GraphQL.In the Original-usable solution, the client is blended with a telecom product and the server is stored in a lambda function. These Lambda functions are invoked only when needed and are stateless.Index.js is present only in the client and create-channel/generate token is in the lambda function(server) only. Please note that only when the user presses the “Talk to agent ” button after the User had a chat with BOT this functionality will start working.

Data can be both in structured as well as unstructured format. Data can be collected from various sources such as mobile phones, social media, big transactions, videos, Internet Of Things devices, financial instruments like stocks, bonds, and news. With the increasing use of Internet, the data generated by these devices is also increasing rapidly, and this data is helpful to make projections for what is upcoming. The use of data is largely dependent on the company analyzing it. New technologies such as machine learning, deep learning, artificial intelligence are data-driven technologies. Large companies use this data to enhance the client experience and execute digital transactions with greater efficiency and minimal mistakes. Organizations need to understand the values of this data otherwise they would be left behind. Big Data is completely revolutionizing the way the stock market used to operate. The reaction to any business, political news is seen in microseconds even before the common people are aware of it. Trading Firms used different sets of algorithms to extract data from websites much faster than naked eyes. Investors are relying on quantitative data to make investment decisions. This helps to remove the emotional stress before taking any trade. The exponential growth in technology is changing the way industries and companies operate. The financial sector is usually considered a data-driven sector. Activities such as mergers and acquisitions, financial statements, accounting, and tax statements require a huge amount of data to be cleaned. There are trillions if not billions of dollars moving across different markets and continents. Many firms are responsible for analyzing such data with accuracy and security to create predictions, find patterns, and create different strategies. Because systems cannot store such huge amounts of data due to lack of space and security, analysts are using cloud services. Cloud-based solutions not only reduce the cost but also help in making the data accessible for anyone in need of it. This data can be used to analyze different business models, their profitability and create financial models based on them. These are among the few applications of Big Data in Finance. Big Data is and will be helpful to all aspects of any business. Let it be Marketing, Finance, Operations, or Human Resource as well.

Broadcasting began with AM radio, which came into popular use around 1920 with the spread of vacuum tube radio transmitters and receivers. Before this, all forms of electronic communication (early radio, telephone, and telegraph) were one-to-one, with the message intended for a single recipient. The term broadcasting evolved from its use as the agricultural method of sowing seeds in a field by casting them broadly about. It was later adopted for describing the widespread distribution of information by printed materials or by telegraph. Examples applying it to “one-to-many” radio transmissions of an individual station to multiple listeners appeared as early as 1898. You have the traditional linear broadcasting most commonly found on conventional living-room sets, now supplemented by branded mobile applications and browser-based channels. All of this viewing activity generates data, which tells us what people are watching and how they’re going about it. In isolation, a lot of this information will be pretty useless, but bring it all together and new doors begin to open. In the past, content owners would pump content out without really knowing what happened to it afterward; any insight thereon was lacking in real accuracy. Now we have access to so much information, however, we can shun the extrapolated surveys and analyze to our hearts’ content. The result is an opportunity for broadcasters to dramatically improve the way they develop and distribute content. Along with this, the rise of social networks is also adding to the complexity of how content is being curated and shared. According to a report by report in Fortune, “about 85% of Twitter users who are active on Twitter during prime-time say that they tweet about TV content they are watching”. This report also shows that in the U.S alone there were close to a billion T.V related Tweets, 90% of which came from a mobile device. As every social media user becomes a content curator, distribution platforms are looking to deepen their social integration to increase their reach, deliver the next big hit and hold the interest to the audience long enough to generate profits. Media and broadcasting companies today need real-time operational intelligence with deeper insights into their consumer behaviors and sales and profit trends. The good news is that despite the growing business complexity, today there is enough data that can be easily mined to gain information and improve the odds of the programming bets and serve the audience better. This needs taking a systematic approach towards analytics to Broadcast Media Analytics and Entertainment Prescriptive Analytics engine have the answers.  vital alternatives are backed up with real-time figures, no more guessing while the final decision is yours   Blackcoffer is an India and European Union (Malta) based enterprise software and analytics consulting firm.

The Operating Systems were mostly Windows with a few RHEL instances. The client had multiple applications running on the servers ranging from Biz-Talk, SAP Basis, MM, Sharepoint, SCOM, SCCM, etc. The main objective of the client was to prevent underutilization or over-provisioning of resources due to unpredictable demand. Blackcoffer Team collaborated with Transalta and executed alongside their team to meet the infrastructure and timeline goals. The goals of migration VMware to AWS Client were:  900+  Windows Server 2008 Windows Server 2012 R2 RHEL 7  VMware Database:   The applications running on the instances varied from Biz-Talk, SAP Basis, SAP MM, SAP Security, Sharepoint, SCOM, SCCM, etc.  Development, Test, Pre-Production, Production An initial understanding of the existing environment was necessary to develop a business case for migration. Through the data on the actual utilization of the on-premises resources, we created a more accurate forecast of the total cost of ownership (TCO) to run these workloads in AWS. We analyzed their environment, created a map of interdependencies, and determined migration strategies (e.g., lift-and-shift, re-platform, etc.) to build a detailed migration plan with priorities for each application. At this stage, we set up a secured, and well-architected multi-account AWS environment (AWS Landing Zone). As part of the readiness and planning phase, we created a migration plan (which includes building experience through initial migrations) and refined their business case. We also focused on building the baseline environment (the “landing zone”), driving operational readiness, and developing cloud skills. In this phase, the focus shifted from the portfolio level to the individual applications. Each application was designed, migrated, and validated. We needed the capability to automatically migrate thousands of applications from different source environments (physical, virtual, and cloud-based) to AWS. These applications typically involved widely used commercial and open-source databases. Additionally, we required a one-time migration of a large volume of data to AWS. As applications were migrated, we optimized their new foundation, turned off old systems, and constantly iterated towards a modern operating model. At this stage, we operated, managed and optimized workloads in the cloud efficiently. Ideally, we built it off the foundational expertise we had already developed. If not, we would have used the first few application migrations to develop that foundation to improve and sophisticate their operating model. : AWS Server Migration Service, AWS Database Migration Service, VMware Cloud on AWS  AWS Site-to-Site VPN AWS Client VPN We designed the Virtual Networks by creating appropriate CIDR’s to avoid overlap between on-premises and Cloud VPC’s. The client had an on-premises Cisco Firewall ASA (Adaptive Security Appliance). Hence, we decided to create a Site to Site VPN Gateway.   We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/how-is-ai-used-to-solve-traffic-management/", "title": "How is AI used to solve traffic management? | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the most important branch of computer science in this era of big data. AI was born 50 years ago and came a long way, making encouraging progress, especially in machine learning, data mining, computer vision, expert systems, natural language processing, robotics, and related applications. Machine learning is the most popular branch of AI. Other classes of AI include probabilistic models, deep learning, artificial neural network systems, and game theory. These classes are developed and applied in a wide range of sectors. Recently, it has been the leading research area in transportation engineering, especially in traffic congestion prediction. Traffic congestion prediction provides the authorities with the required time to plan in the allocation of resources to make the journey smooth for travelers. AI traffic management is poised to revamp urban transportation, relieving bottlenecks and choke-points that routinely snarl our urban traffic. This will help us reduce not only congestion and travel time but will also reduce emissions. Traffic congestion mostly occurs due to the negligence of certain factors like distance maintained between two moving vehicles, traffic lights, and road signs. congestion leads to higher fuel consumption, increased air pollution, unnecessarily wastage of time & energy, chronic stress & other physiological problems, whereas higher traffic violations are the major cause of road fatalities. Intelligent traffic management systems refer to the usage of AI, machine learning, computer vision, sensors, and data analysis tools to collect and analyze traffic data, generate solutions, and apply them to the traffic infrastructure. AI can use live camera feeds, sensors, and even Google Maps to develop traffic management solutions that feature predictive algorithms to speed up traffic flow. Siemens Mobility recently built an AI-based monitoring system that processes video feeds from traffic cameras. It automatically detects traffic anomalies and alerts traffic management authorities. The system is effective at estimating road traffic density to modulate the traffic signals accordingly for smoother movement. The integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning will support many smart transportation applications including emergency vehicle preemption, transit signal priority, and pedestrian safety. Air traffic management stands to benefit significantly from artificial intelligence (AI) under its reliance on repetitive activity – which lends itself to analysis and machine learning. In addition, much of the complexity is embedded in the driving factors that deliver safe air traffic control: for example flight planning, flow management, safety assessments, and conflict prediction. Every year a large number of new vehicles appear on streets worldwide, contributing to traffic congestion. AI and deep learning technologies can play a vital role in managing traffic by collating and analyzing data from a variety of sources. Insights from them can accelerate traffic movements. The future of AI in traffic management would give birth to smart AI applications that automate and accelerate processes. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Intelligent Traffic Management (ITMS) can help tackle & solve many such issues related to traffic law enforcement. It can facilitate a smooth, convenient & safer experience for commuters by improving road traffic discipline. Such a system can’t only help law enforcement agencies in penalizing the offenders but can act as a deterrent as well. Intelligent Traffic Management System (ITMS) is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based application coupled with cameras installed at the traffic junctions, which provide a tool to detect and identify vehicles disobeying traffic rules and generate real-time alerts at the Central Command Center. It can automatically challan the offenders as per law of the land and can send it electronically to the violators. Each e-challan is associated with supporting evidence data in terms of snapshots & videos. This system can also track the flow and pace of traffic movement to provide real-time traffic management. In addition to improving traffic conditions, ITMS also contributes towards smart city goals like environmental sustainability. To improve traffic behavior & avoid congestions in a city, a Traffic management & enforcement system can be deployed to solve traffic-related issues, including but not limited to – Automated Number Plate Reading, Red Light Violation Detection, Speed Violation Detection, Triple Riding & No Helmet Detection, Free Left Turn Obstruction, Wrong-Way Driving, No Seat Belt & Mobile phone usage while driving, Hot listed vehicle detection, Traffic Flow & Congestion detection, etc. Such an ITMS system can be integrated with the existing CCTV & Traffic Control system to provide a holistic solution towards preventing the current traffic menace. Not only this, various AI-based traffic analytic can be deployed over existing Traffic enforcement and surveillance system also, with minor tweaking & adjustments, resulting in a highly optimized solution at a lower cost to the public exchequer. An AI-powered system, trained in deep learning can reduce traffic. Commuters can plan their journeys as per system updates. Since it takes every small detail of roads into account, an AI-powered system will keep the drivers and road authorities one step ahead. Here are a few significant advantages of having an AI-powered system for traffic analysis:- The system can analyze traffic in different lanes with enough precision to ease traffic movements. Using the data, drivers can reduce their commuting time significantly. Effectively, drivers and road authorities can make better decisions to avoid traffic congestion. Every critical information about road conditions, from road accidents to congestion, puts driver and road authorities one step ahead. An AI-powered system has the potential to analyze traffic across multiple regions. It can map the most efficient routes and alter traffic signals to improve traffic conditions. AI and machine learning algorithms identify the least-efficient vehicles, track their path and speed and change the traffic signals ahead of the vehicles.  This eliminates much of the inefficient starting and stopping at intersections and minimizes fuel consumption. As far as using Artificial Intelligence in open space, such as roads, is concerned, it can be considered to be a possibility to install an   traffic management system as part of the infrastructure before launching the self-driving vehicles. An AI-enabled traffic management system can provide greater leeway to self-driving vehicles as they can then be directed and controlled more by the external environment.  Recently, the Delhi Traffic Police has obtained permission from the Ministry of Home Affairs to set up an intelligent traffic management system (ITMS) which will work on radar-based monitoring with the help of Artificial Intelligence. One of the key tools in the system will be automated traffic signals. It will help the Delhi Traffic Police to analyze the traffic pattern, volume, number of vehicles and collect them on a cloud which will be further used to manage the traffic. It will also contain features like high-resolution CCTV cameras to capture commuters and motorists breaking the laws and automated number plate recognition cameras (ANPR) to directly send the challan (fine slip) to the homes of lawbreakers. With Artificial Intelligence working with traffic signals based on traffic volume, the congested roads can be opened up for a longer duration for more traffic to clear up leading to a reduction in congestion. Traffic congestion prediction is getting more attention from the last few decades. With the development of infrastructure, every country is facing a traffic congestion problem. The development of artificial intelligence and the availability of big data have led researchers to apply different models in this field. Deep learning algorithms became more popular with time as they can assess a large data set. However, a wide range of machine learning algorithms is yet to be applied. Therefore, a vast opportunity for research in the field of traffic congestion prediction still prevails. The power of AI that propels a lot of the data analysis of these systems, is also what powers the navigation systems of ride-hailing as well as last-mile delivery operators. Deliveries or order fulfillment that had to be delayed in the past, can now be enhanced significantly as cities around Asia continue taking up such intelligent traffic systems.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/credit-scoring-model/", "title": "Credit Scoring model | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "A credit scoring model is a tool that is typically used in the decision-making process of accepting or rejecting a loan. A credit scoring model is the result of a statistical model which, based on information about the borrower (e.g. age, number of previous loans, etc.), allows one to distinguish between “good” and “bad” loans and give an estimate of the probability of default. The fact that this model can allocate a rating on the credit quality of a loan implies a certain number of possible applications: The model provides a score that is related to the probability that the client misses a payment. This can be seen as the “health” of the client and allows the company to monitor its portfolio and adjust its risk. The model can be used for new clients to assess what is their probability of respecting to their financial obligations. Subsequently, the company can decide to grant or not the requested loan. The model can be used to understand what the driving factors behind default are. The bank can utilize this knowledge for its   The model can be used to understand what the driving factors behind default are. The bank can utilize this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. A credit scoring model is just one of the factors used in evaluating a credit application. Assessment by a credit expert remains the decisive factor in the evaluation of a loan. The history of developing credit-scoring models goes as far back as the history of borrowing and repaying. It reflects the desire to issue an appropriate rate of interest for undertaking the risk of giving away one’s own money. With the advent of the modern statistics era in the 20  century, appropriate techniques have been developed to assess the likelihood of someone’s default on the payment,  the resemblance of his/her characteristics to those who have already defaulted in the past. We will focus on one of the most prominent methods to do credit scoring, the logistic regression. Despite being one of the earliest methods of the subject, it is also one of the most successful, owing to its transparency. Although credit scoring methods are linked to the aforementioned applications in banking and finance, they can be applied to a large variety of other data analytics problems, such as: Such questions can all be answered within the same statistical framework. A logistic regression model can, for example, provide not only the structure of dependencies of the explanatory variables to the default but also the statistical significance of each variable. How one interprets the coefficients in regression models will be a function of how the dependent (y) and independent (x) variables are measured.  In general, there are three main types of variables used in econometrics:  continuous variables, the natural log of continuous variables, and dummy variables.  In the examples below we will consider models with three independent variables: Listed below are three models.  In each case, the right-hand side variables are the same, but the dependent variables differ.  In each of these regressions, the dependent variable will be measured either as a continuous variable, the natural log or a dummy variable.  Define the dependent variable: Below each model is the text that describes how to interpret particular regression coefficients. β1 =∂Yi/∂x1i = a one-unit change in x1 generates a 100*β1 percentage point change in the probability yi occurs β2 =∂Yi/∂ln(x2i) = a 100% change in x2 generates a 100*β2 percentage point change in the probability yi occurs β3 = the movement of x3i from 0 to 1 produced a 100*β3 percentage point change in the probability that yi occurs Model is the key to the solution to all our problems. While the independent variables can be interpreted the way are and how they influence the dependent variables.   We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

Advances in AI software and hardware, especially deep learning algorithms and the graphics processing units (GPUs) that power their training, have led to a recent and rapidly increasing interest in medical AI applications. In clinical diagnostics, AI-based computer vision approaches are poised to revolutionize image-based diagnostics, while other AI subtypes have begun to show similar promise in various diagnostic modalities. In some areas, such as clinical genomics, a specific type of AI algorithm known as deep learning is used to process large and complex genomic datasets.  AI has two main applications in genetics: identification of harmful genes and treatment of disease. Let’s take a look at how each of these applications works. Also, with some good GPS trackers, you can implement them on your vehicle. AI is also being used to identify genetic mutations within tumors using 3D imaging. AI is very useful in personalized medicine, which requires treatments to be specified to one patient’s needs versus another. The 0.1% of our DNA that is unique to us has more than three million differences. The rise of AI in genomics is unsurprising. Genomics – a ‘big data’ field – requires computational approaches to interrogate the enormous volume of data generated by sequencing technologies and to marry it in meaningful ways with other biological and clinical data. Analyzing these datasets for new biological insights can be especially difficult when the rules have to be explicitly predefined, step by step, within the computer code. Instead, machine learning techniques can learn from data without the need to specify explicit rules. Although a highly useful tool, AI is not without challenge the key issue of AI in genomics is scale – with the amount of genomics data being generated exponentially growing. Slavé Petrovski, Head of Genome Analytics and Informatics at AstraZeneca’s Centre for Genomics Research (GCR) says that – “AI in genomics can be extended across different omic studies, such as transcriptomics.” Although there are challenges of having the infrastructure and resources to cope with large datasets and mine it effectively if managed correctly the problem is eliminated. Slavé Petrovski highlighted a key piece of research, conducted by AstraZeneca, which presented a multi-dimensional machine learning framework, taking into account 52 layers of information including gene expression, human disease literature, and mouse phenotypes. This approach is proposed as a “support framework for objectively and quantitatively triaging potential novel disease target genes. Another focus within genomic AI is the strengthening of data. Petrovski remarks that this area is “constantly evolving,” but a key observation is that the method adopted is often not as important as the underlying data. This means that the information inputted into AI systems must be of high quality or it cannot be used to its full potential. Genetics is always a data-driven science and largely utilizes machine learning to capture dependencies in data and derive biological hypotheses. However, the ability to extract new insights from the exponentially increasing volume of genomics data requires more expressive machine learning models. By effectively combining large data sets, deep learning has transformed the field, and now, it is becoming the method of choice for many genomics modeling tasks, including predicting the impact of genetic variation on gene regulatory mechanisms such as DNA accessibility and splicing. In recent years, deep learning has been widely used in diverse fields of biology. In biology, applications of deep learning are gaining increasing popularity in predicting the structure and function of genomic elements, such as promoters, enhancers, or gene expression levels. The application of deep learning to genomic datasets is an exciting rapidly developing area and is primed to revolutionize genome analysis. Deep learning has been successfully implemented in areas such as image recognition or robotics (e.g., self-driving cars) and is most useful when large amounts of data are available. In this respect, using deep learning as a tool in the field of genomics is entirely apt. Although it is still in somewhat early stages, deep learning in genomics has the potential to inform fields such as cancer diagnosis and treatment, clinical genetics, crop improvement, epidemiology and public health, population genetics, evolutionary or phylogenetic analyses, and functional genomics. Also, in recent years, deep learning (DL) methods have been considered in the context of genomic prediction. The DL methods are nonparametric models that provide flexibility to adapt to complicated associations between data and output and adapt to very complex patterns. The applications of deep learning (DL) methods in genomic selection (GS) to obtain a meta-picture of GS performance and highlight how these tools can help solve challenging plant breeding problems. We also provide general guidance for the effective use of DL methods including the fundamentals of DL and the requirements for its appropriate use. The main requirement for using DL is the quality and sufficiently large training data. There is clear evidence that DL algorithms capture nonlinear patterns more efficiently than conventional genome-based. Deep learning algorithms can integrate data from different sources as is usually needed in GS and it shows the ability for improving prediction accuracy for large breeding data. It is important to apply DL to large training-testing data sets. Functional genomic analysis in the field in which deep learning has made the most inroads to date. The availability of vast troves of data of various types (DNA, RNA, methylation, chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, chromosome interactions, and so forth) ensures that there are enough training datasets to build accurate prediction models relating to gene expression, genomic regulation, or variant interpretation. Other features are identification of long noncoding RNAs or splice-site prediction can also be analyzed. As more data becomes available, better models will be able to be trained, thus resulting in even more precise and accurate predictions of genomic features and functions. Although deep learning holds enormous promise for advancing new genomics discoveries, it should also be implemented mindfully and with appropriate caution. Deep learning should be applied to biological datasets of sufficient size, usually on the order of thousands of samples. Even though the use of AI and deep learning can solve many problems related to genomic data, the use is challenging and not cost-effective at all. It needs high-quality machines and skilled experts. But as it was said that – ” If it’s worth it then it’s nothing to worry about.” But if we succeed in applying the concept of deep learning and AI in genetics with cost-effectiveness it will create a history in the world of science and biology and it is possible that humans can reach new heights of genetics and the human genome.

Compared to the early days there have been remarkable differences in the methods of consultation with a doctor. In the years that have passed by, consultation for a disease with a doctor was quite hectic. It involved waiting, traveling, etc. But with the advent of telemedicine opportunities, this has completely changed. It is a rural area that has been completely blessed with the invention of telemedicine. Today a considerable amount of people are able to consult doctors remotely. Not just doctors, but specialists   This has been of great importance as far as rural people are concerned. There are a lot of telemedicine tools that have been found. There are a lot of areas like   etc where the facility of telemedicine has been practiced. Most of the patients are truly benefitting from telemedicine. Patients are pretty satisfied with the consultation they are getting. They don’t have to travel now. They can consult doctors and other specialists from remote areas. The cost of consultation has become pretty much affordable. Moreover, they get exposed to highly efficient and qualified experts in the field of medicine. On the other hand, there can be patients who do not fully get satisfied  . Rather they might feel that they need to have a direct talk with the doctor, which can boost up their confidence and also it helps to maintain a better relationship with the doctor and patient. The patients feel trust when they talk to doctors face to face. Moreover, doctors also might be able to console their patients when they have direct interaction with their patients. There could also be patients who doubt if these virtual methodologies are really trusted worthy or not. It is so because, while the patients have direct contact with their patients, the qualifications are visible to the patients. So there shall be no question of distrust. There are major challenges like better connectivity of the internet, without which the patients will not be able to have continuous interaction with the doctors. Technical glitches may hinder the consultation too. Moreover, emergency situations cannot be addressed beyond a limit through telemedicine.

The importance of digital analytics is that it allows for a data-driven approach to marketing, and as such it can produce better results. The primary objective of the project is to help the businesses in knowing their target audience, understanding the trends in digital marketing, and providing insights on the analytics part of their website performance. Use the digital analytical data to determine if your business’ aims are in line with the customer’s wants and needs. As the picture of the customer’s needs unfolds, adjust the objectives accordingly.   The main aim of this project is to assist the businesses to improve their website performance with the use of technologies like Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager and dashboards built on Whatagraph.    Google Analytics is integral to tracking and measuring data from a number of digital platforms, but especially web metrics and customer behaviour. For example, through Google Analytics, you can see when people drop out of the buying process, perhaps they abandon while on the cart page, which would then inform your decisions on how to improve the check-out process. Because Google Analytics measures traffic from a variety of devices and sources and integrates with other online platforms, such as Google Ads, it is a handy tool to get an overview of your business’s digital analytics. Google Tag Manager is a tag management system (TMS) that allows you to quickly and easily update measurement codes and related code fragments collectively known as tags on your website or mobile app. Once the small segment of Tag Manager code has been added to your project, you can safely and easily deploy analytics and measurement tag configurations from a web-based user interface. When Tag Manager is installed, your website or app will be able to communicate with the Tag Manager servers. You can then use Tag Manager’s web-based user interface to set up tags, establish triggers that cause your tag to fire when certain events occur, and create variables that can be used to simplify and automate your tag configurations.A Tag Manager container can replace all other manually-coded tags on a site or app, including tags from Google Ads, Google Analytics, Floodlight, and 3rd party tags.  The whatgraph dashboards previews the important metrics related to the website including conversions, events, number of users and performance about ads and campaigns by the website. This dashboard helps in drawing some of the useful insights for the website notifying the strengths,gains and areas of improvement.  Main deliverables for the project are:  The main technical challenge faced was that any changes in Google Analytics are operational after 24 hrs. Thus, we can’t judge if the setup works as per required.  We had to wait for 24 hours to check the setup. We could use real-time report as well to check the setup on-the spot.  This analysis helps to improve website performance, understanding user behavior, understanding the impact of business campaigns and improvising the UI/UX to increase their potential users.  Having insight into your clients’ behaviour and demographics can help you make decisions about serving them the right products at the right time for maximum chances of a sale. Such data could include a client’s persona, such as their age, location, and areas of interest. Some of the common metrics that are important in digital analytics include: : Some examples are pages per visit, bounce rate, and average duration of each visit. Pages with an exit rate of 75–100% show that you need to examine the problem with the content and improve upon it. These pages will make the customers either exit or explore the website further. These are other websites that link to your website. This indicates whether the goal of your website was achieved, be it a sale of a product, a free giveaway, or a subscription to a newsletter. This tells you about the loyalty of the customers. This refers to the time lapse between the first visit and the sale. The shorter the time taken, the better it is for your business.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/how-metaverse-will-change-your-life/", "title": "How Metaverse will change your life? | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "Ever since the stone age, humans have been evolving in one way or the other. In the recent past, this wave of evolution is looking stronger than ever. If you look at the major turning points in human history, the invention of the internet happens to be one of the most significant ones. The internet has largely revolutionized humanity which makes us question “what the future holds for us?”. In 1991 for the first time, the word “World Wide Web” was coined which only contained a few sentences on a single page. A couple of years later a video went live on another website, things escalated quickly as you can see. Fast forward a few years later and you have YouTubers having a greater audience than a couple of news outlet giants. Throughout history, technology has made advancements that have given rise to entire new industries and economies. The metaverse is highly anticipated to be that jump in human history. You would’ve been wondering what’s all this noise about this metaverse has been about? Well, we are here to explain. This first started on 29  November 2021 when Facebook announced that it was going to rename itself as ‘META’. Ever since then, speculations and conspiracy theories have been making rounds on the internet, and likely so. Because of the very limited information we have regarding the metaverse, it makes it obvious for one to speculate. META promises us a digital world powered by Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality, and Virtual Reality giving us a life-like experience from the comfort of our homes. We will discuss the things metaverse has to offer and the threats it poses below. Metaverse as the name suggests a virtual reality space where users can interact with computer-generated systems and other users. It was also taken as a reference from the book “Snow Crash” written by Sci-fi writer Neal Stephenson. Metaverse is the extension of the internet we use but in a 3-D environment wherein the user is a part of the experience rather than just witnessing the experience on an audio-visual level. As early as its inception has taken place, the metaverse already has numerous takers, the majority of them being high-end gaming companies and tech giants like Microsoft. This alone is enough to indicate that major companies are already adopting the metaverse. The clothing giant H&M recently came up with a virtual store wherein the customers could roam around the store and shop some clothes but just virtually. I can already see the metaverse becoming a hit in the shopping arena as it could save the money being spent by companies on setting up stores, rather than spending the same amount of money on developing high-quality tech infrastructure. We can observe many businesses shift to the Metaverse similar to how businesses started to shift to cyberspace and social media. Virtual Reality is a step up and businesses are preparing to take part. The metaverse as already mentioned has diverse applications in various fields. So here are some of the few applications of the metaverse which may be of the most significance- As businesses continue to offer customers immersive experiences, entering the metaverse will be a no-brainer. With the Metaverse, businesses can explore new opportunities and stay up to date on the latest technologies. NVIDIA has already capitalized on the hype built around the metaverse by creating an Omniverse to connect the worlds within the Metaverse. It allows designers, researchers, and creators to collaborate and sell their products in virtual spaces. As we become more and more immersed in the metaverse, companies will continue getting more of our data which will further help them in making marketing strategies for individuals hence increasing the reach of their business. With the rise of the metaverse, many small companies will also be able to stand at the same level as the relatively larger companies, thus giving an equal playing field to all. It is almost impossible to imagine the metaverse, the other, just-as-real world, operating without cryptocurrency. In a world where speed, transparency, and security are almost fundamental, crypto becomes a necessity rather than an option. At its heart, cryptocurrency is the perfect medium of exchange for this exponentially emerging hybrid world. First, prompt, swift, and frequent transactions, like selling your vintage and immediately buying a new one, or even getting your hands on that NFT needs decentralization and transparency, where the power to approve and validate your desirous transactions rests with not just one centralized authority or hub, but rather with every participant in the network collectively, making it more democratic, accessible and quick! You do not repose your trust. Hacks and data breaches occur frequently, but if people are going to be expected to engage in a wholly online and virtual environment, the underlying platform on which they are going to be using needs to be secure. just in a single person. With the rise of COVID-19, we all have seen how companies and offices quickly adapted themselves to the online hybrid model of work thus saving a lot of money that would’ve been otherwise spent on office maintenance (electricity bills, water bills, housekeeping staff, etc). Now, with the ongoing advent of the metaverse, offices can be built in a virtual set-up where employees can adopt working in a hybrid work-from-home environment. Though this type of working model is economically feasible, it won’t be an easy task to implement taking into account the toll it will take on employees’ mental health. I won’t be surprised if a decade later or so, all offices go virtual The one thing the metaverse is going to completely revolutionize is the Entertainment industry. Both games and films in the past years have been striving to make the user experience as realistic and engaging as possible. We have all seen 3-D films, have at least heard about a 4-D movie and what it feels like to be in the theatre. By now, the only level we reached by now is giving the movie-goer a life-like experience by making seat movements, usage of surround sound, etc. But shortly, we can experience the films by being in the film itself. I know that it sounds like a scene from a sci-fi movie, but this is what advanced AR and VR do. The concept of cinema halls can also vanish shortly as everyone will have to buy a Meta Occulus to watch a movie. Now coming to the gaming industry, gaming with VR is already popular but the gaming quality isn’t great. The overall graphics of a VR game does not even match the video quality of PC games, thus making it an inferior gaming experience. But as time passes, the technology is expected to develop. We have already seen games like Pokemon Go which apply the concept of Augmented Reality(AR) brilliantly to say the least. This game became so popular that it was once considered dangerous for children as it was very addictive and to be honest, a bit risky also. But the future of these games is not far, soon we all will be in a situation which we had only seen in the movies until now. One of the most promising applications of the metaverse lies in healthcare. The healthcare sector will get revolutionized with the advent of the metaverse. Just like many industries are now racing to have a presence in the metaverse, healthcare will be performed in the metaverse as well. It already is. Forms of therapy that take place using virtual reality and augmented reality technologies are all happening in the metaverse. Physical therapy, cognitive therapy, support groups, and rehabilitation have all been taking place in the metaverse even before the term existed. More recently, Medtronic acquired the company Digital Surgery and Zimmer Biomet announced   which leverages the Microsoft HoloLens to merge real and virtual worlds. The investments being made by these large med-tech companies, combined with a growing number of startups developing AR and VR solutions, illustrate the way the surgical environment may change in the coming years. Another example is   which brings global healthcare professionals together for simultaneous education, training and planning as well as collaborative medical procedures. According to the company website, it uses advanced cloud and real-time communication technology to “empower clinicians to practice their skills with the utmost precision to ensure everyone receives the best healthcare delivery anytime and anywhere.” Here are some of the threats we could face in the future: The metaverse will likely require the addition of many new sensors into the home. Each one will monitor users as they browse the virtual world and interact with other avatars. By increasing the surface area of connected devices, users are thus widening the doorway into their network. In other words, they’re adding more avenues that bad actors can take when breaking into the network and stealing information. Biometric information, body language, physical proportions, and social behaviors will likely become a point of targeted advertising in the metaverse. Enabled by the many sensors that monitor those factors, that information could be exploited for hyper-targeted advertising, personalized messaging, or manipulation. Per CPO Magazine, sensors will provide “unprecedented insight into human biological processes and psychology in real-time.” Those sensors need to be safeguarded against bad actors hoping to take advantage of this sensitive information.  VR-connected devices could become a vacuum of latent data collection. In the same vein as Amazon’s Alexa, AR glasses, cameras, microphones and sensors could become major violations of privacy. Such devices continuously monitor for activation phrases or actions. But while doing so, they’re also actively storing snippets of information. With unparalleled access inside the home, user information, conversation, and action could be compromised even when users aren’t accessing their devices.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/how-to-increase-social-media-engagement-for-marketers/", "title": "How to increase social media engagement for marketers? | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "Social media is such a staple of our evolving digital culture that it’s almost hard to imagine a time without updates, likes, comments, and shares. People are more concerned about how their food looks than about how it tastes. Thus, it has become necessary for any brand to have a social media presence. The phrase “Out of sight, out of mind” has never been so apt than in today’s time. Social media is as much about engagement with other people as it is about sharing content. It’s why we call it “social” media. Social media engagement simply is the interaction between the customer and the brand on social media platforms. Where else are you going to find a huge database of your target demographic who are already in the mind frame to read, click on, and share your message? In practicality it is not about a one-off communication but more about the construction of a long-term relationship with your target customers. Hence, when we talk about such a relationship it is imperative to consider the positive actions of users as a reaction of any brand’s engagement tactics. A fundamental customer journey can be envisaged in the form of customer funnel. The touchpoints available at every step can be shown as:  To understand the reach of social media by the use of numbers How many retweets on Twitter? How many reactions to the post on Facebook? How many likes on Instagram? How many shares on Linked In? This seems to be the new age Resume. Thus, a good question or mystery for any brand is how to measure their social media engagement. As with most online actions, it’s often difficult to measure offline benefits. More often than not the online campaigns do not drive any conversions on the same day/week, but a user may see those posts and become more familiar with the brand. That familiarity, later on, might result in him choosing that brand over an unknown competitor. Social media engagement as a result helps businesses in developing their brand’s personality, improves visibility, and becomes its voice. Customers exhibit dynamic behavior based on the type of product. It could range from picking and variety-seeking to high involvement processes comprising extensive information search. Top of the mind recall rules due to this purchasing behavior implies that targeted advertising and marketing is extremely important. No one engagement strategy can be applied across brands. Each brand’s strategy must differ based on what the brand is trying to sell, its target customers, and the beliefs of the brand. Some of the key aspects of marketing strategy that we have influenced as vital cogs in the digital marketing wheel are: Influencer marketing involves a brand collaborating with an online influencer to market one of its products or services. Here the audience doesn’t care much about your brand but the opinions of the influencers. An influencer as being someone who has: 2017 saw Chanel being named as the most influential luxury brand on social media. Since then, it has continued to grow and diversify its portfolio, while providing constant engagement to its plethora of followers, especially on Instagram.  Cross-channel marketing or multi-channel marketing is the practice of using multiple channels to reach an audience. Because not everyone uses every single platform, it’s a good idea to have a presence on a few, and share some of the same content across the different networks. What makes a difference in this marketing strategy is the choice of platforms. Apart from using basics like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter a clever use of Spotify, YouTube, or IGTV to showcase the brand can make a real difference. The luxury vehicle brand, Land Rover’s cross-channel marketing includes the Google Display Network, homepage masthead and Masthead in Lightbox ads on YouTube, and visibility through mobile, search, and Google+. The brand’s digital campaign included four different influencers who created visual content for their blogs by taking trips to places like Glacier National Park and the Appalachian Mountains and Land Rover’s microsite. Their cross-channel efforts resulted in 100 million impressions from YouTube, and a 10% increase in search ad CTR. Further results found that online leads from its digital channel efforts now account for 15% of the brand’s total sales. The content created on social media must add some value addition to the customers. The brand must constantly keep informing the customers about their existing products, new products, achievements of the brands, or even casual content. There should be “Wow, I didn’t know this” factor. Only then will they become regular followers of the brand. An example of this would be a cosmetic brand posting make-up tutorials. Fenty Beauty is one such prime example, which has built up to 1.4m followers within just 4 days of its launch, eventually garnering close to 10m followers, with Rihanna being one of their icons. “Customer is King” is a known concept. It is the foundation of traditional marketing. So while we shift to Social platforms brands must not forget them. Understanding their needs, addressing them, inviting them to respond and take part in the brand’s online activities while keeping it interesting and entertaining for the customer is the key. Founder and CEO of Glossier, Emily Weiss, described the brand as, “the first socially-driven beauty brand.” Glossier was certainly the pioneer in the term ‘Instagram brands’ – using the platform not only to build awareness but also to have focused conversation with the customer. Glossier often crowdsources product development, asking its Instagram followers what they’d like to see next.  The content creation must be dynamic and suitable for the current season, festival, or event that is happening. People must be able to relate to the posts and they must get excited after seeing it. Starbucks does a marvelous job when it comes to being dynamic. Their one-off recipes and continuous hype around seasonal events and related drinks have won them a silver IPA Effectiveness award for its social strategy in 2018. The launch of its now iconic ‘Unicorn Frappuccino’, spurred on the trend of brands deliberately creating ‘Instagrammable’ food and drink. As a result, there are now 557,232 posts using the hashtag #PumpkinSpiceLatte. Now of course the real motive behind any marketing activity is to eventually sell the product. So it becomes extremely important to not lose the essence of the product while marketing. In simple terms, the content or strategy must not leave the customer confused about what the brand actually does or what it is trying to sell. To support the product-centric statement, Oreo is the best example. Oreo’s social media strategy has never diverged from its original formula. Completely product-focused and yet always creative, the brand continuously finds ways to put its cookies center stage. The ‘Daily Twist’ campaign to mark its 100th birthday, saw the brand turn its Oreo cookie into something of cultural relevance for 100 days, including Elvis Presley, a baseball, and a rainbow flag in support of Pride.  “A picture is worth 1,000 words”. This adage has never been more apt than in the age of social media.  This is why visuals are so important in any marketing strategy. You can talk about a product all day, but until you’re able to put it in front of someone’s eyes, it’s not going to have nearly the same effect. Visual content marketing is a great way to make this happen and can be broken down into six basic types- comics, memes, infographics, photos, videos and visual note-taking. Coca-Cola has been a leader and trendsetter in the visual content marketing space for years. The 2020 initiative video paved the way for multiway communication, as opposed to the single way process that was prevalent.  The barrier for electronic platforms has always been the loss of touch. Customers often complain that till they don’t touch, try or test the product they are not convinced if they want to purchase it. This can also be true for products that are new and the customers need to be educated about its use. Hence it becomes important for brands to bridge this gap as far as possible through their online medium. Product demonstrations are considered one of the most promising and upcoming applications of AR technology, giving brands a way to provide an immersive experience to consumers. Gucci partnered with Snapchat for the first global branded AR shoe try on the lens, hugely increasing fanfare! Corporate Social Responsibility should not be missed when it comes to social media engagement. If a brand has the reach to spread awareness then they must use it. Creating content to spread social awareness adds an emotional touch too. If a customer connects with a brand on an emotional level its hard for competitors to break it. Dove’s steady and impactful social message still stands out as marketing that’s more than just marketing. The ‘Real Beauty’ campaign has been refreshed multiple times since it first launched in 2004. Dove’s latest campaign once again highlighted the core message, going far beyond surface aesthetic to focus on the beauty of real human values. The ‘Courage is Beautiful’ campaign successfully honored the healthcare workers who have been working selflessly throughout the 2020 pandemic. The fact remains that the share of mind and voice are key elements to being the dominant force in the world today. Social media marketing has leveraged all the elements and made its presence felt in every customer engagement. Finding unique ways to really stand out among the competition is key to a successful digital marketing strategy. Newer and more customized tools to feel the pulse of the market come up every single day, to meet the ever-changing needs of marketing heads. At the end of the day, ‘customer is indeed king’. And companies would do well to remember it!  We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

The year 2020 comes with a lot of unprecedented threats to humans as well as to nature. While no business was left insulated from its effect, small businesses were one of the most affected, as they rely on day to day sales and keep the inventory minimum, based on the demand of customers and have a low margin to maneuver. In an article by HSBC’s Navigator, which described the preparedness and contingency plan for the future, Indian business rated high among its peers. The businesses in India have shown resilience to face adversity which can be attributed to varying degrees of adjustment and adaptability. The businesses, while able to adhere to government guidelines have managed to facilitate their customers efficiently and effectively. However, the impact on micro, small, and medium enterprises cannot be left unattended.  The Indian subcontinent has an estimated  of MSME, out of which   are in rural areas which   of the total employment provided by this Sector. The MSME sector with   people constitutes 40% of the total workforce. As per the ministry of commerce MSME contribution in  . With the huge contribution toward GDP as well as export, the impact on the national economy due to the shock in the MSME sector from the pandemic will be equally devastating. While different businesses face different types of obstacles, we have pointed out 8 of the most common issues faced by them. For any business, cash in hand is oxygen. The small business which usually has at most 1-month cash to run the business if the revenue stream dries up, which in this tough time has to improve gradually. To manage the optimal cash balance is the key to success in this tough time. The optimal cash balance here, defined as “the less of the amount of cash outflow in form rent, employee salaries, and raw material without postponing the payable as they are doing what banks have to do, to the inflow from sale”.  In any given situation, business is like juggling between multiple tasks to optimize the performance while maximizing the revenue. The current situation has added another layer of challenge. This challenge will test management skills in various aspects of our business owner.  With this article, we have pointed out the major challenges and possible ways to alleviate the impact. As   quotes, “Every problem is a gift—without problems we would not grow”, the current market has wiped out their share in the market which gives an opportunity to other businesses to grow and lower the expense. While there may be many facets that need to be handled precisely, communication is one of the major tools that will create a positive environment among workers or teams which will influence the customer behavior and result in terms of revenue. The communication will also help to increase productivity and create trust in a supply chain which will improve the cash conversion cycles and working capital ratio. Marketing through word of mouth has no added cost but the benefit can be scaled too much-required revenue. The choice of an effective marketing tool can also influence our target customer and will influence their will to buy the product or service(s) strategically. Cash from operating activity improves if we were able to lower our expenses. To lower these expenses, small business owners have to create a different plan (good, average, and worst) keeping the 6-month frame in mind. Breaking down them in monthly targets would further help them to identify the actual scenario and update the strategy accordingly.   As   quotes, “You only have to do a few things right in your life so long as you don’t do too many things wrong.” this is the right time to do the right thing and over time businesses will ripe its benefits.  We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/how-to-overcome-your-fear-of-making-mistakes/", "title": "How to overcome your fear of making mistakes? | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "The Covid-19 crisis and its fallout including recession, layoffs, and uneven economic pain-as well as recent protests over police brutality and demands for racial justice, have presented many of us with challenges that we’ve not encountered before. The high-stakes and unfamiliar nature of these situations have left many people feeling fearful of missteps. No one can reduce mistakes to zero, but you can learn to harness your drive to prevent them and channel it into better decision making. Use these tips to become a more effective worrier. Our culture glorifies fearlessness. The traditional image of a leader is one who is smart, tough, and unafraid. But fear, like any emotion, has an evolutionary purpose and upside. Your concern about making mistakes is there to remind you that we’re in a challenging situation. A cautious leader has value. This is especially true in times like these. So don’t get caught up in ruminating: “I shouldn’t be so fearful.” Don’t be ashamed or afraid of your fear of making mistakes and don’t interpret it as evidence that you’re an indecisive leader, or not bold, not visionary. If you have a natural tendency to be prevention-focused, channel it to be bold and visionary! (If you struggle to believe this, identify leaders who have done just that by figuring out how to prevent disasters.) Fear of mistakes can paralyze people. Emotional agility skills are an antidote to this paralysis. This process starts with labeling your thoughts and feelings, such as “I feel anxious I’m not going to be able to control my customers enough to keep my staff safe.” Stating your fears out loud helps diffuse them. It’s like turning the light on in a dark room. Next comes accepting reality. For example, “I understand that people will not always behave in ideal ways.” List off every truth you need to accept. Then comes acting your values. Let’s say one of your highest values is conscientiousness. How might that value apply in this situation? For example, it might involve making sure your employees all have masks that fit them well or feel comfortable airing any grievances they have. Identify your five most important values related to decision-making in a crisis. Then ask yourself how each of those is relevant to the important choices you face. Repeat this process for each of your fears. It will help you tolerate the fact that we sometimes need to act when the course of action isn’t clear and avoid the common anxiety trap whereby people try to reduce uncertainty to zero. Worrying can help you make better decisions if you do it effectively. Most people don’t . When you worry, it should be solutions-focused, not just perseverating on the presence of a threat. Direct your worry towards behaviors that will realistically reduce the chances of failure. We can control systems, not outcomes. What are your systems and processes for avoiding making mistakes? Direct your worries into answering questions like these: Is the data you’re relying on reliable? What are the limitations of it? How do your systems help prevent groupthink? What procedures do you have in place to help you see your blind spots? How do you ensure that you hear valuable perspectives from underrepresented stakeholders? What are your processes for being alerted to a problem quickly and rectifying it if a decision has unexpected consequences? When we’re scared of making a mistake, our thinking can narrow around that particular scenario. Imagine you’re out walking at night. You’re worried about tripping, so you keep looking down at your feet. Next thing you know you’ve walked into a lamp post. Or, imagine the person who is scared of flying. They drive everywhere, even though driving is objectively more dangerous. When you open the aperture, it can help you see your greatest fears in the broader context of all the other threats out there. This can help you get a better perspective on what you fear the most. It might seem illogical that you could reduce your fear of making a mistake by thinking about other negative outcomes. But this strategy can help kick you into problem-solving mode and lessen the mental grip a particular fear has on you. A leader might be so highly focused on minimizing or optimizing for one particular thing, they don’t realize that other people care most about something else. Find out what other people’s priorities are. Fear grabs us. It makes it difficult to direct our attention away. This is how it is designed to work, so that we don’t ignore threats. Some people react to fear with extreme hypervigilance. They want to be on guard, at their command post, at all times. This might manifest as behavior like staying up all night to work. That type of adrenalin-fueled behavior can have short-term value, but it can also be myopic. A different approach can be more useful for bigger picture thinking. We need leisure (and sleep!) to step back, integrate the threads of our thinking, see blindspots, and think creatively. Get some silent time. Although much maligned, a game of golf might be exactly what you need to think about tough problems holistically. As mentioned, when people are fearful they can go into always-on monitoring mode. You may have the urge to constantly look at what everyone else is doing, to always be on social media, or check data too frequently. This can result in information overload. Your mind can become so overwhelmed that you start to feel cloudy or shut down. Recognize if you’re doing this and limit over-monitoring or overchecking. Avoid panicked, frenzied behavior. On its own, being afraid of making mistakes doesn’t make you more or less likely to make good decisions. If you worry excessively in a way that focuses only on how bad the experience of stress and uncertainty feels, you might make do or say the wrong things. However, if you understand how anxiety works at a cognitive level, you can use it to motivate careful but bold and well-reasoned choices.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/gender-diversity-and-equality-in-the-tech-industry/", "title": "Gender diversity and Equality in the tech industry | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "Gender diversity is an equal representation of all genders in workplaces. One of the most important sectors where there is under-representation of gender diversity is the technological industry. Gender diversity means you have an equal opportunity which is not limited by gender. But, the true reality is gender diversity is a far outcry in the world. Gender diversity isn’t a new topic but an old and global phenomenon and technology industry is not a stranger to it.  Women are often underrepresented in the technology sector. To understand the gap, let’s look at some statistics. After looking at these staggering numbers, we see how biased gender diversity is even in the technological sector. With rapid industrialization and education about the importance of rights, gender diversity is very important in today’s world. Gender equality represents a society that has lesser violence and provides a safer world for everyone. It is also directly proportional to sustainable development and ensures human rights to everyone. As today’s markets are increasing along with customers’ preferences, to understand customer profiles and build products we need gender diversity in our organizations. Equal representation helps in a better decision-making process for a positive impact. Men and Women invest back into their families and having gender equality and diversity helps build values into families and households. Empowering individuals not only help themselves but also the economy of the nations. Gender equality and diversity should be built into organizations’ beliefs and values. Global Gender Gap Report (2017) Perception: If we see the word “gender”, it is a socially constructed definition. And this definition changes as per different cultural norms. In a much broader term, our society is also not aware of the concept of binary and non-binary gender, which includes queer, Trans, and Intersex individuals as well. The socially acceptable thing is to have gender expressions as per our gender identity. So, when it comes to choosing their career, people tend to choose a job role that gives them higher social belongingness. E.g. We see more women(as compared to men) in nursing careers as it requires more feminine qualities. There are different versions of this perception: which we can see either in the society(in terms of socially assigned gender roles) or in the workplace(in the form of gender discrimination, stereotypical thinking, sexism, etc.). E.g. As per their assigned roles in society, women are most likely to take care of their family and children, and this affects their income and career growth. The motherhood penalty is a term defined by sociologists which states about the inverse correlation between income level and the number of children, i.e. there is also an income difference between a mother and a non-mother employee. As per OECD data(2012), there is a 7% reduction in wages for women per child. Lack of economic opportunities: Even in the tech industry, women are paid less than men. As per ILO data(2019), on average women are paid 20% less than men worldwide. Even when it comes to promotion, men are preferred more. It is to be noted that the numbers are even worse when there is intersectionality involved. E.g., a transgender woman will be paid less than a white woman and so on. As per the National Centre for Transgender equality, one out of two transgender people faces adverse effects: including 23% were denied a promotion, 44% were passed over for a particular job position and 26% are fired from their workplace just because they are transgender. We can improve this scenario from the perspective of different stakeholders who are involved. For Society : Creating Tech awareness from School level: As per the HDR report( 2017), no. of boys pursuing STEM program is 97% higher than girls. One way to improve this is to introduce more strong role models to advocate for this issue. Minority gender communities should be aware of the multiple job opportunities and career growth available in this field. These job roles are not even gender-specific anymore. For developing countries like India, STEM scholarship programs can be introduced from the secondary education level. Address Bias/Stereotypes: It is to be noted that perceptions, stereotypes, and biases are not just something we learn in school but our upbringing also creates these, the things we watch, listen, and read daily. So, it also becomes the duty of the society to create a more inclusive environment. E.g. A more privileged person should fight for the fundamental right of the less empowered or less privileged person in society. There should be active encouragement from parents, teachers, and educators for students in STEM programs regardless of their gender identity. For Companies: To promote gender diversity in the workplace, companies need to focus on three things: Unbiased Recruitment policies: Generally, there is a lot of unconscious bias and prejudices when hiring women, trans, intersex, and queer individuals. There needs to be a diversity and inclusivity team in the HR itself that addresses these issues. A blind recruitment drive can be conducted where there is no need to mention gender in any of the documents. Having structured questions during the interview might help to remove any unconscious biases. Diversity sensitivity training: Workplace policies need to create a company image that hires everyone irrespective of their gender identity and can even keep it optional in all the job formalities and documents. Conducting proper sensitivity training to employees is essential as they need to use correct pronoun/gender-neutral language. Not just sensitivity training, strong workplace policies need to be in place which deal with any form of harassment or gender discrimination.  To create accountability and transparency in their process, companies can also share diversity and inclusivity company data. Retention policies: Creating Mentorship models: Including proper maternity leaves, child care facilities, and flexibility of working hours/remote working arrangements can be helpful for minority gender in keeping their work-life balance. Develop support programs for these communities who are joining after maternity leave. It might be in terms of psychiatric or mentorship support. Increase Pay parities: It can be done in the following ways: Lastly, there needs to be proper government policies in place which provide a constitutional or legal framework starting from the basic education level. It may begin from increasing the gross enrollment rates of all students in schools (irrespective of their gender identity) for developing countries( like India) to have proper compensation policies in the workplace(as similar to what states like California, New York has adopted) to ensure pay parity.   We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/global-financial-crisis-2008-causes-effects-and-its-solution/", "title": "Global financial crisis 2008 causes/effects and its solution | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "The Financial Crisis of 2008 started as a crisis in the subprime mortgage market (i.e. in a market where lending of loans is done to people who may have difficulty in maintaining the repayment schedule or in simple terms, loans were given out to people without proper checks and low credit scores) which ultimately led onto a huge global collapse. The   or   is considered the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. In the year 1996, there was a dot-com boom (or otherwise known as the dot com bubble) in the United States, a period of massive growth in the use of the internet because of which the stock market prices started increasing rapidly. However, around the year 2000, it dropped which led people and investors to withdraw their investments from the stock market rapidly. It led to the decline of the price of shares in stock markets and the interest rate plummeted to around 1% very quickly in a short span. Investors were now looking for a brighter option than investing in stock markets.      Rise and fall of the Dot Com Bubble As interest rates went lower and lower, real estate prices started rising and the US Govt also encouraged people to buy houses and properties. The demand for the same started rising rapidly and investors now found a great option to invest in (i.e. in Real Estate). During that same time, Investment Banks saw an opportunity, chimed in and started buying loans from Banks in bulk and clubbed multiple loans under a complex derivative called CDO (Collateralized Debt Obligations) and started providing it to these Investors after getting a credit rating of “AAA” (Very Safe Investment) from the Credit Rating Agencies. Investors naturally fell for it and started buying these CDOs. So now, the risk factor of these loans got transferred from the Banks to the Investment Banks and then again to the CDO Investors. With the high buying demand of CDOs, Investment banks started demanding or pressurizing Banks to provide even more Loans so that they can provide more CDOs to the Investors. However, Banks had already provided loans to people with good credit history and regular income people. But in the hope of getting even more credit from Investment Banks, these same banks then started giving out subprime housing loans to people with low credit scores. Approximately $174Bn worth of loans were given out during the period 2000-2007 and most of them were clubbed as CDOs with a “AAA” rating from the Credit Rating Agencies. Approximately 70% of these CDO’s were marked with a “AAA” rating. Investment Banks and Credit Rating Agencies were now enjoying large profits during this time. Moody’s (a credit rating agency) profits increased 4x times during that period (2000-2007). Looking at the huge profits being made by the Investment Banks and Credit Rating Agencies, Insurance companies (like AIG) now started giving out insurance on these CDOs to the investors and they called it CDS (Credit Default Swap). AIG believed that since the CDOs were rated as “AAA” (Very Safe Investment), the failure chances of these CDOs were very minimal. They misjudged or were unaware of the fact that some of the loans that were clubbed under these CDOs were Sub Prime loans. Now CDO Investors started buying out CDS from AIG and other companies to safeguard and protect them from any losses. AIG then started making huge profits because of the premiums that the investors had to pay. But they never realized the outcome if by any chance the CDOs fail at some point in time. Thus, the risk factor again got transferred from the CDO investors to the Insurance Companies.  Flow Diagram showing how the Risk Factors got transferred Coming to the loan borrowers now, Sub Prime Borrowers from banks were unaware of the fact of Adjustable Rate Loans (interest rate of these loans keeps changing) and thus had to pay lower interests at the start but more interest rates later on. The borrowers started defaulting on these loans when the interest rates increased dramatically around 2007 and thus banks had to then resell those houses to make up for the loans defaulted.  Added to the problem was the fact that borrowers were not spending any amount of money from their pockets while taking loans and banks were providing the full amount of loans. Almost 50% of the borrowers did not pay anything from their own pocket and bought the home only using the housing loan. This led to a huge increase in the defaulters of borrowers and ultimately banks had to auction houses to gain credit back. With the high-interest rates and no one to buy the auctioned houses, this ultimately caused a chain reaction and banks were no longer receiving credit. The prices of Real Estate started falling drastically and people with good credit scores who had earlier taken housing loans also started defaulting because the price of their houses/homes fell below the loan amount that they had taken earlier. Banks stopped receiving money and also because of this chain reaction, the value of CDOs ultimately came down to 0. Some Investors went for huge losses and few Investment companies went bankrupt (ex – Lehman Brothers). Moreover, insurance companies had to pay back those investors who had taken insurance. As a result, some of the insurance companies also went bankrupt. AIG too almost lost about $100Bn in paying back the investors who had earlier insured their CDOs. However, the US Govt. finally decided to bail out AIG in order to save them from going bankrupt. CDOs and CDSs were not regulated during that time by the Federal Reserve and thus this whole situation ultimately led to credit crunch (became very difficult to get loans) and the whole economy of the US underwent a crisis that led to a global impact all around the world. Unemployment increased manifold and many new businesses had to shut down. Global trades all around the world also saw a crisis and finally, Global Recession hit the World.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/is-perfection-the-greatest-enemy-of-productivity/", "title": "Is Perfection the Greatest enemy of Productivity? | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "What’s perfection really? Does every person expect perfection from oneself or someone else? Or is it in certain amounts? Many times the certain question comes to the mind when we think about what we deem perfect. But how do we verify it? Let us understand this through the work of three individuals who know are to be put on a task in carpentry on a budget. All are given Rs. 5000 (Assumed) to complete this task. They can’t go beyond this budget. Manish, Vinay, and Sameer need to make a stool for themselves each. Manish has no understanding of carpentry; he learns from YouTube. Vinay took his carpentry lessons during engineering, so he has a practical idea of how to make a stool. But Sameer is a Carpenter, so he has a total understanding of the material, process, and final product. Let us start with Manish. Understand that the task is to get their jobs done. Manish has two options here. He can either order parts and assemble it himself or order the material required such as wood, glue, nails, etc and then work on it before the assembly of the final product. The only difference is his lack of expertise in this field. Vinay has the same options but has practical experience from his carpentry classes during the workshop in Engineering. Sameer has an advantage since he has both skill and experience perfected over a course of time. All three are given three days for the task. Since Manish finds it easy to assemble the stool using parts procured from another carpenter; he talks to a carpenter he knows and orders 3 leg parts, 6 horizontal support bars, and one circular base which will sit on the top. Vinay thinks he will be able to shape the parts because of his experience as a student and orders several cylindrical wooden leg parts, cuboidal bars, and a thick sheet. Sameer has all the required material in his shop and he begins to work on the stool on the first day. Manish and Vinay wait for a day for the parts to come. They begin to work on the second day. Manish uses the tricks learned from YouTube videos; uses a hammer to place the nails purchased from a nearby shop in the pre-made hole, applies glue in certain areas as directed in the video, and places weight on the assembled stool. He waits for the glue to cure. Vinay uses borrowed drill bits, drill machines, cutters, sandpapers purchased from a shop, etc, and starts working on the wooden parts as soon as the parts arrive in the morning. He is able to recall his carpentry instructions and attempts to shape the parts based on drawing of his product he made last night. Sameer meanwhile has completed his assembly and has put the assembly to rest for the glue to cure. On the third day, each of them has the stool ready. They evaluate their own work and notice certain facts. Manish notices that he did complete the task but, his stool was wobbly and not glued well. It could fall the moment he sits on it. Also, he forgets to polish the wooden parts and give it a professional finish since he forgot to watch that bit of video over YouTube. Vinay completes the task his stool is sturdy and cured well overnight. But there are minor issues with it. One of the three legs is cut short by a few mm and the stool, a tad unstable. Sameer on the other hand completes the task with a good product. The stool is well-balanced, and polished, as he   from him. Sameer is   with his work and finds it to stool  . Manish thinks he did his   considering he had no experience of the task to be done. He is   with his work. But Vinay is unhappy, he could have done better and made the product better. He doesn’t find his efforts well put and thinks he     enough and hence his stool is nowhere  . Understand that all of them had a set of skills and experience, but only Sameer had the right skills and experience to produce a perfect product. Manish and Sameer were satisfied and happy with their work. Manish made a wobbly stool which could break the moment someone sat on it but happy he gave the task a go. He thinks put the efforts and he did a good job. It was only Vinay who could not overcome the fact that his work was not perfect. In Vinay’s case, it can be observed that he could not deliver what he learned from carpentry classes. The reason is simple, he put effort but didn’t have the experience. Experience mattered. Since Vinay thinks otherwise, he believes he has the perfect skills to complete the task but he could not deliver the results. He is not satisfied with his results and wishes to spend another day working on the stool on his own to get to his idea of the perfect result. In this case, the idea of perfection itself is misplaced. You see, the end product made by Vinay and Manish would not match Sameer’s but the task could have been completed had they understood where their shortcomings lied. For both, it was their skill. Sameer had the perfect skill to get the expected result which resulted in better productivity, others didn’t. And in this story, every individual put effort regardless of the result. But some were satisfied and some dissatisfied. Their satisfaction made their creations perfect in their eyes and dissatisfaction made one believe he wasn’t productive enough.   “Perfection is   and productivity is     given a certain amount of effort”.  If you aren’t satisfied, you won’t find anything perfect. You would just waste both your time and effort over something that doesn’t suit you in the first place, as explained in the story before. Satisfaction will determine how you perceive perfection and defines where your threshold for perfection lies. The real enemy is dissatisfaction. You get demotivated and restless. You lose sight and discontinue only because you are unable to pass your own expectation. So, it’s the only obstacle that comes in between productivity, from time to time.

This process starts with labeling your thoughts and feelings, such as “I feel anxious I’m not going to be able to control my customers enough to keep my staff safe.” Stating your fears out loud helps diffuse them. It’s like turning the light on in a dark room. Next comes accepting reality. For example, “I understand that people will not always behave in ideal ways.” List off every truth you need to accept. Then comes acting your values. Let’s say one of your highest values is conscientiousness. How might that value apply in this situation? For example, it might involve making sure your employees all have masks that fit them well or feel comfortable airing any grievances they have. Identify your five most important values related to decision-making in a crisis. Then ask yourself how each of those is relevant to the important choices you face. Repeat this process for each of your fears. It will help you tolerate the fact that we sometimes need to act when the course of action isn’t clear and avoid the common anxiety trap whereby people try to reduce uncertainty to zero. Worrying can help you make better decisions if you do it effectively. Most people don’t. When you worry, it should be solutions-focused, not just perseverating on the presence of a threat. Direct your worry towards behaviors that will realistically reduce the chances of failure. We can control systems, not outcomes. What are your systems and processes for avoiding making mistakes? Direct your worries into answering questions like these: Is the data you’re relying on reliable? What are the limitations of it? How do your systems help prevent groupthink? What procedures do you have in place to help you see your blind spots? How do you ensure that you hear valuable perspectives from underrepresented stakeholders? What are your processes for being alerted to a problem quickly and rectifying it if a decision has unexpected consequences? When we’re scared of making a mistake, our thinking can narrow around that particular scenario. Imagine you’re out walking at night. You’re worried about tripping, so you keep looking down at your feet. Next thing you know you’ve walked into a lamp post. Or, imagine the person who is scared of flying. They drive everywhere, even though driving is objectively more dangerous. When you open the aperture, it can help you see your greatest fears in the broader context of all the other threats out there. This can help you get a better perspective on what you fear the most. It might seem illogical that you could reduce your fear of making a mistake by thinking about other negative outcomes. But this strategy can help kick you into problem-solving mode and lessen the mental grip a particular fear has on you. A leader might be so highly focused on minimizing or optimizing for one particular thing, they don’t realize that other people care most about something else. Find out what other people’s priorities are. Fear grabs us. It makes it difficult to direct our attention away. This is how it is designed to work so that we don’t ignore threats. Some people react to fear with extreme hypervigilance. They want to be on guard, at their command post, at all times. This might manifest as behavior like staying up all night to work. That type of adrenalin-fueled behavior can have short-term value, but it can also be myopic. A different approach can be more useful for bigger picture thinking. We need leisure (and sleep!) to step back, integrate the threads of our thinking, see blindspots, and think creatively. Get some silent time. Although much maligned, a game of golf might be exactly what you need to think about tough problems holistically. As mentioned, when people are fearful they can go into always-on monitoring mode. You may have the urge to constantly look at what everyone else is doing, to always be on social media, or check data too frequently. This can result in information overload. Your mind can become so overwhelmed that you start to feel cloudy or shut down. Recognize if you’re doing this and limit over-monitoring or over checking. Avoid panicked, frenzied behavior. On its own, being afraid of making mistakes doesn’t make you more or less likely to make good decisions. If you worry excessively in a way that focuses only on how bad the experience of stress and uncertainty feels, you might make do or say the wrong things. However, if you understand how anxiety works at a cognitive level, you can use it to motivate careful but bold and well-reasoned choices.

There is one group of people, having good knowledge about the real potential of AI, who believe that AI can be a novel solution to many problems that the world is facing today. There is another group of people who are merely threatened by the thought of AI taking over the world. The field of AI took birth when Alan Turing in 1950 had this thought “Can machines think?”. Later in the 1980s, with the adoption of “expert systems” by the companies around the world, the booming of the field of AI was initiated. Initially, it was a matter of awe for everyone to see the results of what AI can achieve. AI’s growth in the past few decades has been exponential and it has transformed the way we live, work and solve challenges. AI has made its impact in a wide variety of areas including healthcare, education, business and many more. But, one of the areas of highest impact that AI has made recently is in the environment and climate change. AI can strengthen climate predictions, enable smarter decision-making for decarbonising industries from building to transport, and work out how to allocate renewable energy. In recent years, AI has been a game-changer in how many people, as well as organizations, deal with climate change. Microsoft believes that artificial intelligence, often encompassing machine learning and deep learning, is a “game-changer” for climate change and environmental issues. The company’s ‘AI for Earth’ program has committed $50 million over five years to create and test new applications for AI. AI is increasingly used to manage the intermittency of renewable energy so that more can be incorporated into the grid; it can handle power fluctuations and improve energy storage as well. Wind companies are using AI to get each turbine’s propeller to produce more electricity per rotation by incorporating real-time weather and operational data. AI can also improve energy efficiency on the city scale by incorporating data from smart meters and the Internet of Things (the internet of computing devices that are embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive data) to forecast energy demand. Besides, artificial intelligence systems can simulate potential zoning laws, building ordinances, and flood plains to help with urban planning and disaster preparedness. One vision for a sustainable city is to create an “urban dashboard” consisting of real-time data on energy and water use and availability, traffic and weather to make cities more energy-efficient and livable. Hotter temperatures will have significant impacts on agriculture as well. Data from sensors in the field that monitor crop moisture, soil composition and temperature help AI improve production and know when crops need watering. Incorporating this information with that from drones, which are also used to monitor conditions, can help increasingly automatic AI systems know the best times to plant, spray and harvest crops, and when to head off diseases and other problems. This will result in increased efficiency, enhanced yields, and lower use of water, fertilizer and pesticides. When we talk about the effect of AI in the environment and climate, both sides of the coin must be elucidated. So, apart from all the positives discussed above, the usage of AI also has a downside. Last year’s World Economic Forum report showed that while AI can address some of Earth’s environmental challenges, it is important to manage it properly. According to the forum and experts in the field, AI has the potential to accelerate environmental degradation. The use of power-intensive GPUs to run machine learning training has already been cited as contributing to increased C02 emissions. Although AI has been around for about half a century, the question of environmental impact – and other ethical issues – is only arising now because the techniques developed over decades can now be used in combination with an explosion in data and strong computational power. For all the advances enabled by artificial intelligence, from speech recognition to self-driving cars, AI systems consume a lot of power and can generate high volumes of climate-changing carbon emissions. A study last year found that training an off-the-shelf AI language-processing system produced 1,400 pounds of emissions – about the amount produced by flying one person roundtrip between New York and San Francisco. But there are ways to make machine learning cleaner and greener, a movement that has been called “Green AI.” Some algorithms are less power-hungry than others, for example, and many training sessions can be moved to remote locations that get most of their power from renewable sources. The key, however, is for AI developers and companies to know how much their machine learning experiments are spewing and how much those volumes could be reduced. To prevent this, the proposition by the World Economic Forum report is that advancements in “safe” AI should be pursued, to ensure that humanity is not developing AI that is harmful to the environment. Specifically, the World Economic Forum said in its report that AI developers “must incorporate the health of the natural environment as a fundamental dimension.” This means safeguarding against models that will demand the consumption of energy or natural resources beyond what is sustainable, among other factors. In a sense, all programs need to be designed with the dimension of environmental protection and improvement in mind. In the future development of AI programs, it will also be important to note the environmental impact of creating these systems in the first place. According to an academic study on energy usage for deep learning processes, the creation of an effective AI might be costly to the environment. Nearly 300,000 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions are created during the process of training a single model. This is basically equal to the emissions of five average cars in the United States. Considering the negative environmental impact in addition to the positive implications of AI and climate change will be crucial, moving forward. There is always room for improvement, some pioneers of machine learning recently published a paper called   was discussed at a major AI conference. David Rolnick, a postdoctoral fellow of the University of Pennsylvania said “call to arms” which means to bring researchers together. This paper covers thirteen areas of research where machine learning can be used, including energy production, CO2 removal, education, solar geoengineering, finance and many more. The main idea is to build more energy-efficient buildings, creating new low-carbon materials, high tech monitoring of deforestation and greener transportation sources. Artificial intelligence and machine learning can be a medium but the real work is to be done by us as a caretaker of mother earth.  The kick start was already done by   in 2011 which regulates the collaboration of data science and climate science. It covers a wide range of topics like improving prediction of extreme events such as hurricanes, paleoclimatology, collecting data from ice cores, climate up-down scaling and its impact on us. Claire Monteleoni, a computer science professor at the University of Colorado concludes that AI/ ML models generally forecast for the short-term. There is a significant difference when it comes to long-term forecasting. The first system was developed at Princeton in the 1960s. All the AI/ ML models developed till now revolve around atmosphere, oceans, land, cryosphere or ice. AI can help to achieve new heights with the amount of data collected at this point of time, and compute more complex climate conditions using climate modeling algorithms. We all know that climate change is real and the rise in atmospheric temperature the proof, but to make it more realistic, Montreal Institute of Learning Algorithms (MILA), Microsoft and ConscientAI Labs uses Generative Adversarial Networks popularly know as GANs to simulate what mother earth will look like with the rising sea levels, atmospheric temperature, air pollution and intensive storms. The project is deployed for the people to look at what their places will look like in the future when there will be a significant climate change. Short answer, yes. Tracking of carbon emission is one of the agendas of the UN. For this year 2020, the UN’s goal is to prevent new coal plants from being built. Satellite images come into picture using deep learning techniques, data science researchers can analyze these high quality satellite images and track the emission. Google is expanding its horizon of nonprofit’s satellite imagery, including gas-powered plants emissions which can be used by researchers to track the pollution. There are countries organizations which govern CO2 emission on the ground level but these data are unreachable by global monitoring associations. AI can automate the analysis of images of power plants to get regular updates on emissions. It also introduces new ways to measure a plant’s impact, by crunching numbers of nearby infrastructure and electricity use. That’s beneficial for gas-powered plants that don’t have the easy-to-measure plumes that coal-powered plants have.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/can-you-be-great-leader-without-technical-expertise/", "title": "Can You Be Great Leader Without Technical Expertise | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "The word “leadership” can bring to mind a variety of images. For example, A political leader, pursuing a passionate, personal cause or An executive, developing his/her company’s strategy to beat the competition. Leaders help themselves and others to do the right things. They set direction, build an inspiring vision, and create something new. Leadership is about mapping out where you need to go to “win” as a team or an organization; and it is dynamic, exciting, and inspiring. In my point of view we cannot become a good leader without technical expertise because every task in the organization it’s required a lot of skills, knowledge, consistent, enthusiastic, patience, motivating, inspiring, industrious, and critical thinking on the basis of the field we are doing. A leader should have the ability to motivate self and others, effective oral and written communication, critical thinking skills at the working team and delegating a task. Good leaders do have these abilities and if we wanted to create a future leader. They need to take in a large volume of information and to take the essential elements that define the core problem to solve. They need to organize a team to solve these problems and to communicate to a group, they need to established trust with a group and use the trust to allow the team to accomplish the work more than it could be done alone. Though all these skills we have but it’s would not sufficient to make us a great leader because to excel and utilize these abilities in practice we need a lot of technical expertise in a particular domain. For example, Like in a hospital if the head of the hospital is lead by other people rather than Doctor then the hospital would become worse at a point because the person from other fields he could not lead and understand the real scenario and mechanism that the hospital is functioning and he would not understand the staff and the patient as well. Hence, to lead the hospital Doctor is deserved who knows his own field how to lead and understand the real scenario of it. That’s why being a leader requires technical expertise to have great knowledge and understanding about his own organization. Every person if they want to become a leader they should have technical expertise on their own organization so that their organization would run smoothly, hence nobody could run other organization if we do not have the technical expertise on that field. So, be a leader, not a boss which makes your life much better, as they’re a saying that “ A good objective of leadership is to help those who are doing poorly to do well and to help those who are doing well to do even better.” We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/how-you-lead-a-project-or-a-team-without-any-technical-expertise/", "title": "How you lead a project or a team without any technical expertise? | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "Have you ever wondered what’s common between Sir Alex Ferguson, Pep Guardiola, and Jose Mourinho? I know it might look a lame question, especially to the ardent football followers. At first instinct, the answer is that they are regarded as the top managers in the football universe. #UCLwinners. But when given a closer look, these managers, weren’t that great when it came to their careers as football players. Any naïve observer can build a fallacy of causation and correlation that those who don’t have a great career as a football player will go on to become a great football manager. But is this restricted just to football? Mike Brearley, one of the greatest captains in the history of cricket and the author of the book the art of captaincy, wasn’t the prolific batsman of his time. Our former President, A P J Abdul Kalam didn’t have a political background, but was still appointed as the president of our country and went to become one of the finest presidents our country has ever had. So, can it be stated with confidence that great leaders need not be the expert in their respective fields? Let’s understand the leadership role, types of leaders, and explore a few more perspectives before we arrive at a conclusion.  Let’s start by first understanding what or who is a leader. A leader is not a position or a designation. It’s a virtue if employed correctly. From a janitor to the CEO, from a student to a researcher, from a content writer to a philosopher everybody is a leader. (#leadersareeverywhere) So, what are the virtues of a leader? One of the famous personality trait theories, the Big 5 personality trait theory is always linked closely with leadership. As per the various researches, the personality traits of extraversion, openness, and conscientiousness are associated with leaders more often than the other two traits. Not just these humble and empathetic are also considered as the adjectives that are frequently associated with leaders. But nowhere is technical expertise related to a leader.  As stated by Colin Powell Leadership is the art of accomplishing more than the science of management says is possible.   If leadership is an art and leaders are the artists then more or less the leaders can be viewed as directors of the films who are organizing, arranging, managing, and directing the scenes. Another analogy for that can be the orchestra where the conductor is using the baton/stick to set the rhythm of the band. So, is it necessary for the conductor to himself or herself by a great violinist? No. When it comes to the corporate sector the leader need not be an expert on the technology but should know how the technology functions so that he/she can utilize it in the best possible way. They can allocate the task of building technology to the right technical experts. And how do the leaders identify the right person for that job? Or how do leaders know what qualities to look for in a person? #Experience. Every great leader once started off as one of the frontline workers or at the bottom of the pyramid in the hierarchical structure. Even though they might not have had the technical expertise in their respective fields, their visionary outlook, their management skills, and the experience they gathered helped them in achieving their targets. Leaders can always take the assistance of the subject matter experts to guide them in situations of technical difficulties. As per the great man, situational and trait theory of leadership, leadership is innate to the person. Leadership though can be conditioned or can be brought out in a person by rewarding him, great leaders show unconditional attachment towards their vision. Everyone knows how to read a map, but which path to choose isn’t something that can be taught. Leaders give the direction or vision to the company and drive it closer to the target that the company wants to achieve. Leadership theories don’t focus on the technical knowledge of the leaders, but rather more on people skills, their approach towards a problem, and how well they guide and hire others to get the job done, which is also evident as per the managerial skills required as per Robert Katz. Though it can be argued that technical experts are also the great leaders in their areas, but these leaders are generally at the middle management level. As per the different leadership styles, a servant leader is the one who always tries to achieve the goal of the team. These leaders are the ones who have a management objective laid out in front of them and they drive the team closer to achieving the target by having the people-first mindset, a collaborative approach towards solving the problem. These are the people or the leaders needed at the execution level of the project or those who are too close to the employees at the bottom-most level. Since the managers at the top of the pyramid don’t get much time to invest in people they appoint the right people on their behalf to get the job done.   Consider an IT firm. So as per the points mentioned above, does it mean that a leader or the manager shouldn’t know how to code? Depends. If the person is the first line manager then he or she should probably know how to code so that he or she can help the team in achieving the target of producing less garbage which might be one of the project’s KPIs. The project manager, who might be an operations manager, (#MBA) from an IT background, probably need not know what line of code is to be written but should know the algorithms or the logic behind the code so that he or she can validate the code from the client’s perspective. The CEO, might not be from an IT background but should know how to run an IT firm rather than the syntax of the code. But in today’s competitive world leaders can’t be one dimensional. They need to have expertise in multiple areas to be at the top. Mike Brearley if got a chance to play a T20 match, won’t even get picked into aside, not because of his age, but because of his not so great looking batting statistics(#Thegamehaschanged). His leadership skills won’t be enough to get him into the squad. But he can be a great leader if selected to coach the top 15 captains in the world today. As we have already discussed the film directors, their job isn’t to teach the cameramen on how to set up or operate (lens settings, etc) the camera. Their job is to guide the cameramen on what angle it should be held and how he or she should coordinate with the lights crew so that a perfect shot is captured. So even if a leader may not be a technical expert of his field, but if he or she has the right approach and mindset, understands the system and its process, then he or she can hire the best talent for the job and can get the work done by guiding the talent, with his or her vision. So, the answer to the question, which we came across in the first paragraph, is yes and no. Depending upon the position in the hierarchy (yes for a front-line manager and no for a CXO) and the type of the leader you are, the level of technical expertise needed varies. Though as stated earlier by Robert Katz, the CXO’s need to have the least amount of technical expertise, the CXO should know how the technology functions or what are the applications. What processes are to be followed to build the technology.  He or she should now what is to be done rather than how it is to be done, (#itsnothowitswhat). Otherwise, even though the company might be sitting on a gold mine but If the leader isn’t aware of that or isn’t learned enough to know what to do with it, no company can succeed even with having all the resources at their disposal. Leaders command respect and don’t demand it and that’s possible when they give value to their front-line employees, seek timely advice from the technical experts, and put the resources to the best of its uses. Otherwise, you will be surrounded by technical experts like dilberts.

Advertisers who participate in Google Local Service Ads will receive a larger ad space with their competitor’s local services ads and they will be able to feature their local businesses throughout organic search queries.  There are various aspects that firms must concentrate on in order to win the Google services ad and so raise their ranking. These enhancements may be implemented if companies obtain current data about their leads and analyse it in order to take appropriate actions in the future. This project was created to give this data in a way that companies can readily understand through the use of visualisations. The graphs will show the increase/decrease in any of the metrics, as well as the manner in which the increase/decrease occurs. It will display all of the crucial data monthly or even by date range to help you keep track of the changes that occur. The solution for the project includes data insights through visualisations which will help businesses to better analyse the available data. This solution will help the businesses in improvising the factors to increase their potential customers and raise their respective ranks.  It is divided into two parts: databases and data dashboard. The databases will store the important data retrieved from the LSA dashboard and use them to calculate some important metrics. The data dashboard will represent those metrics in form of graphs and data in form of tables.  The project deliverables can be divided into two parts:  For extracting the data from the LSA Dashboard, we have made our own tool by python scripts. The automation tool will store data in the excel sheets and google bigquery for respective businesses on a day to day basis. PyCharm for compiling and running the code. JsonViewer for processing  We have used the LSA API to extract data from the LSA Dashboard. Google Sheets API to store data in excel sheets. Bigquery API for storing data in google bigquery. The scripts for the automation tool were written in the Python programming language.  Software Model: RAD(Rapid Application Development model) Model In the RAD paradigm, less emphasis is placed on planning and more emphasis is placed on development activities. It aims to create software in a short period of time. Advantages of RAD Model:  Two types of databases: Google excel sheets and google bigquery.  Google BigQuery Cloud Database with up to 1 TB of free storage is being used. Some minor technical challenges were faced for clients with minimum data. For those, plotting graphs became difficult.  We tried to process the data, remove the blank data spaces and plotted the graph with available data.  It’s undeniable that Google’s Local Services ads (LSA) have changed the way home service businesses advertise online. The pay per lead system designed to provide the end-user with a quick, clean and trusted experience, gives small and medium-sized businesses a better shot at competing with national brands and massive budget operations. To win with the Local Services the businesses need to take care of some factors where data comes to help.  Fig.1: Data Dashboard for individual businesses-1 Fig.2: Data Dashboard for individual businesses-2 Fig.3: Consolidated Dashboard Fig.4: Historical Account Data Fig.5: CPA and CPL datasheet Fig.6: Lead Dispute Status We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/impact-of-covid-19-pandemic-on-office-space-and-co-working-industries/", "title": "Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on office space and co-working industries. | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "COVID 19 has bought the world to its knees. With businesses being shut, travel being banned, schools, and colleges being closed, we have observed an impeccable amount of sorrow and despise along with a great amount of mental torture and destruction. Though situations are improving now, and the lockdowns are being lifted, it is a fact that it cannot be shunned that this virus will have a long term impact on people, and the effects will not only be felt economically and physically but also mentally. We’ve been reading articles regarding the impact of COVID 19 on the economy, education, mental health, and every other possible aspect. But one topic which has not been talked about much is the impact of COVID 19 on office space and co-working industries. Well, it is quite obvious that offices will start functioning now, but, the COVID period hasn’t ended. This means that social distancing will also have to be followed in offices; where it will be a problem to do so because of the lack of adequate infrastructure and space. The same will be the condition in co-working industries, wherein employees of different companies come and work together under the same roof. However, these problems are quite obvious (though people haven’t thought about them much), but the fact which people fail to notice and understand is that the meaning of space is not only limited to infrastructural space which is measured in square foot or square meters; but it also extends to metal space, or for that fact, space in the minds of people for others and their thoughts as well as opinions. Coronavirus has left a big scratch in our country; just the way a car needs repair after an accident, our country will also need repair after the control of this virus. But, unlike a car, our country will require a large amount of time to get restored and to stand straight without any support. Needless to say, the economic stability of our country will definitely be hit because of this reason. But the problem is since the earnings of the employers will reduce, it will subsequently lead to a drop in the salary of the employees. While some employees might be preferred by their bosses and may receive a raise regularly, others might be subjected to unfair treatment and made to do the same amount of work for a lower salary. People tend to overlook the thin line which exists between cooperation and competition. The problem doesn’t arise when such a situation happens wherein an employee is getting paid more than the other, but instead, it arises when people start to compare their earnings as well as benefits to that of others. And in today’s world, where people keep money at the top of their priority list, comparisons will play a very important role in the performance of employees and their company. Since there will exist inequalities and partialities in companies, there will also exist a sense of hatred and competition among the employees of the same company; who will compete to get a better position or a raise in their salary. This may seem beneficial to some as it might compel the employees to work harder and better, but however, will bring huge losses in the long run. The fact is; employees might end up doing unethical acts which will help them to make a better impression in their boss’s eyes. Moreover, since there will be comparisons among the employees, it might happen that the ‘Employee of the Month’ ends up being hated by all other employees in the company. Another situation that might arise is that of bluffing and pretending; wherein employees tend to show that they work very hard but they don’t. This might be practiced by showing the boss that they are working when he is on around, and then chilling the rest of the time when the boss goes home or sits in his office. In fact, employees might also lose interest in working if they sense repeated partialities and inequalities; which they might show by quitting the jobs or not performing to their best. Such situations will definitely arise in companies and offices; wherein employees will compete for attention and resources; which will have a great impact on the company and its functioning. And all this will happen because of only one thing; lack of office mental space i.e. space in the minds of people working together in a particular office for cooperation and teamwork, along with ignorance of the fact that things will get better and eventually the same after some time. Another kind of industry and companies that will be affected due to the long-lasting impact of COVID 19 is the co-working industry and offices. This is because, there will be a shortage of resources and the income of people, but the maintenance cost to be born for the infrastructure, as well the rent will remain the same. Because of this, employees will be told by the company owners to exploit the resources present in the offices and use them to the fullest; to compensate for the losses being born and to make better use of the money being used. However, the number of resources will be the same, and so, there will be a case of competition between employees of different companies to use resources and take benefits of the same. If the above two situations happen to occur at the same time (which they most likely will), we will observe a scene of intra-company as well as inter-company competition. Also, our personal relations with other employees in the company might also be affected due to this comparison and competition; which itself will be a result of limited mental space. COVID 19 will have severe impacts on the office (mental) space of companies and people.  People’s thoughts, how they treat others, along with accepting defeat and rejection will be an important aspect of everyone’s lives. Moreover, we might also observe a shoot in the intensity and frequency of office people going to psychologists; because of repeated rejection and unfair treatment. However, we need to cope with this thing and realize that it is indeed very important for us to start preparing to expand our mental space and that this competition and comparison will not stay for long and should not affect our personal relations and life at any cost.

I would rather make online payment – After lockdown. During this lockdown, one can observe a number of small positive changes in our surroundings. One such positive change is using online mode of payment even if they are small in amount as it counts as a big step towards DIGITAL INDIA and self-development as well. According to Economic Times, 42% of Indians say that they have started using online mode of payment. Some small tasks like mobile phone recharge, bill payments, buying groceries, etc., are some essential tasks that cannot be ignored, and making an online payment is way too convenient for them. Also, multiple schemes have been initiated by the government to promote online payments like Lucky Grahak Yojana and Digi Dhan Vyapari Yojana. The details of the same are as follows: LUCKY GARHAK YOJANA DIGI DHAN VYAPARI The frequently used apps by the consumers and the market share of apps are as follows: Paytm- 33% Google Pay- 14% PhonePe- 4% Amazon Pay- 10% BHIM- 6% Other Apps- 33% Not only the sellers but also the buyers have taken a step forward in making online payments and have been exploring the various offers and discounts. The sellers have started their own online shops and made online payment mandatory in highly contaminated zones. The buyer has also taken advantage of home deliveries to follow social distancing. To add to the advantage of buyers and sellers KYC is no more a necessity to make money transfers. There has been an increase in the services provided by banking sectors as well. The FM Nirmala Sitharaman has provided the directions to not charge for cash withdrawals from ATM’s. Various services like sending and receiving money, blocking cards, credit card payments, credit card pins, etc., are being provided online. E-payment options like Paytm, etc., have been open up for investing money online in stocks, insurance, etc. Even online shopping apps like Amazon have come up with various offers for their in-built wallets. Emerging technologies and high competition among online payment apps are providing benefits to buyers and sellers as well. Sellers have been able to increase their reach with online shops and online payment stands as a guarantee for them. Buyers have been in the most advantageous position ever after the digital payment has come into the market. They are being provided with a number of choices to choose from as well as make instant payments for offers. This all sums up the likeliness of digital payment in the market. So yes, we can say, YOU (DIGITAL PAYMENT) HAVE A BRILLANT FUTURE, CHILD! We all have heard this statement “Precaution is better than cure” and here is the time to follow the same. It has been proven as a fact that the coronavirus can persist on paper for four or five days. That means the coronavirus can persist on the paper currency for four or five days. Thus, it is important to avoid the usage of paper currency. A revolution will take place only when the below poverty population of India will start using the online mode of payment and will be literate enough to not get caught in any scam.

Initiating in China in late December 2019, the virus has since then spread to every corner of the world, infecting millions in its wake. Countries around the world have responded by shutting down their economies and advocating lockdowns of varying degrees. India has arguably had one of the most stringent lockdowns of all countries, restricting the movement of people, goods and effectively transforming every city into a ghost town. Due to such stringent restrictions on movement, the economy has received a fatal blow. The virus arrived in India at a time when the country was already in strife, dealing with a slowing GDP growth rate and an ever-increasing fiscal deficit. The lockdown has simply exacerbated the economic predicament; pushing multiple businesses and industries to a moribund state. Other countries have also faced a similar predicament, particularly in the US and Europe, both being hotspots for virus transmission. However, upon taking a closer look at the global economy, there seems to have been an upward mobilization in some of the sectors in the IT domain. These sectors seem to have exorbitantly increased their scale of operations and have overall reaped hefty profits. So what is it that differentiates these areas from the rest and what can we learn from them? If we look at the evolving IT/ITeS industry around the world, the domains that have flourished in this strenuous time all have had one key characteristic in common; flexibility. These sectors have adopted a more flexible approach to dealing with the lockdown. Be it flexible working procedures or adopting newer, more advanced ways of working in line with the requirements of our time, they haven’t shied away from changing the rules of the game. Let’s look at some of these areas within the tech domain that have been successful in conquering the lockdown. Lockdowns around the globe have confined people inside their homes, with nothing much to do of significance. As a result, social networking sites have reported a gigantic rise in user engagement over the lockdown period. Reportedly, there has been close to a 50% rise in daily text transmissions across messaging platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp in the hardest-hit economies. Twitter has reported a 23% increase in its user base as compared to last year. The data makes it evident that social media platforms are here to reap the benefits of a lockdown situation. Video consumption sites such as YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok are in line to reap massive profits. It’s no wonder that viewership on these platforms has increased manifolds due to lockdowns. These platforms serve to be a distraction from the tragedies of the real world in such stressing times and offer an easy escape. Be it rumors regarding the cure for COVID 19, gossips, or rap battles; these platforms provide viewers with their much-needed dose of distractions. As they say, “ignorance is bliss”. The lockdown has proven to be a miracle for data-mining companies. With such an exorbitant increase in the number of hours spent online globally, these firms now have access to significantly larger sets of data than they otherwise could ever have. Widespread implementation of data-mining has been seen recently with most countries opting for Government-regulated surveillance applications that monitor your movement at all times. Moreover, these applications have access to your personal information as well as medical records. Countries such as South Korea and Singapore are at the helm of relying on such means to control the outbreak. Although noble, such initiatives do raise a red flag with regards to user privacy. The public has been provided with very little information about how these applications operate and what goes on behind the scenes. This creates an atmosphere of obscurity that is frankly harmful to the premise of a democracy. Cloud computing has been on the rise for the last couple of years. However, the pandemic has made it the de facto king in terms of computational services. With an increasing reliance on remote working, the ability to store data in one secure location has turned out to be critical. The cloud computing services such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud have reaped hefty profits in the process. The emerging landscape in the tech world seems to suggest an upward trend in reliability on these services as far as large scale data storage and computing is concerned. Social distancing measures have made it practically impossible for people to physically go shopping for groceries and other necessities. Moreover, a majority of retail outlets in cities have reported negligible engagement, for the fear of transmission of the virus. E-commerce sites have been the real winners in this predicament of global consumerism. With high standards of hygiene and at-home delivery, these sites have provided an easy alternative to retail stores. Other similar businesses include food delivery apps and grocery sites that are also flourishing today amidst the pandemic. Recent weeks have made it evident that E-commerce websites are well on their way to abolish traditional shopping methods. Online streaming platforms consist of a relatively newer approach to entertainment; having only been in existence for the past couple of years. They had already, however, established a name for themselves before the lockdowns. Sites such as Netflix and Amazon Prime had been dominating a chunk of the market share and competing heavily with movie theatres for new releases, for a while now. Now with the lockdown practically deleting theatres and cable TV from the collective psyche of the entertainment industry, they are well on their way to becoming the platform of choice as far as entertainment for the masses is concerned. This has already become evident, with Zee5 India reporting a whopping 80% increase in subscriptions and a 50% increase in the time spent on their site, within the first couple of weeks of the lockdown itself. Another such platform MUBI reported a 28% rise in its viewership in India only a week after lockdown commenced. These facts are a clear indication of the exponential growth that is in store for these platforms, which is unlikely to change anytime soon. The idea of working from home is all set to be the new norm in our professional culture, which requires an easy and effective way to communicate over the internet. Not just audio or text, but video conferencing is the need today. Hence it’s understandable why multiple video conferencing services are set to reap massive profits off of the new norm. Arguably the most popular of these, Zoom has reported a 130% increase in its price share since the beginning of 2020. Another such platform known as the Microsoft Teams collaboration suite, operated by Microsoft, has reported a whopping 12 million increase in its user base in the very first week of the lockdown in the US. This data is only likely to have an upwards trajectory considering the increasing pace at which industries are going online. The Indian IT landscape has also undergone massive cultural changes. According to Rajesh Gopinathan, chief executive officer and managing director of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., the “work from home” model of operations is here to stay. He also claimed that the firms only requires a 25% workforce to be physically present for any project at any of the locations. Tata Consultancy Services which is one of the major players in the Indian IT landscape has shifted almost 90% of its workforce into a remote borderless workspace model, and other smaller firms have followed suit. What it tells us is that we’re headed in a direction we’re unlikely to return from. Remote working appears to be the modern protocol for operations and is unlikely to change anytime soon. However, a major challenge often overlooked in such circumstances is that of an adaptable culture. The culture of workspaces has to be drastically altered and members of the workforce have to dive headfirst into the new way of doing business. This is critical to ensure that the industry can combat the pandemic and recover gloriously. The lockdown has presented us with a stark contrast unlike any other we’ve witnessed. Where on the one hand, the industries mentioned above seem to be exhibiting exponential growth with their people thriving and having every possible resource at their disposal, the unorganized sector and the MSMEs (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises) seem to be at the crux of death. The sector that consists of people for whom having guidelines to work from home is irrelevant as that was never really an option; people with no fixed wages or social security to fall back on during this time of crisis. As a result of the lockdown, several of these MSMEs have effectively become inoperable and have resorted to massive layoffs just to survive. This has resulted in thousands of workers losing their jobs with nowhere to go to for refuge. A chunk of these people includes migrant workers who have lost their jobs and are left with little to no avenue to feed themselves. Not receiving significant support from the government, these people have been initiating treks back to their villages. What is witnessed is a massive influx of migrant workers flooding the highways, walking weeks to find shelter and food. Truck drivers responsible for delivering goods have also resigned stating that they have no means to eat because of the closure of every food joint on the highways. Both these realities present a stark contrast and expose a deep crack in our societal framework. One I reckon won’t heal anytime soon. The COVID 19 pandemic has restructured our social fabric in a way that is unlikely to change anytime soon. The areas that we’ve discussed are likely to become the flagbearers of the digital revolution of the decade. An upward mobilization with regards to massive scale movement of industries online seems pertinent today being led by these domains in the IT industry. An unfortunate consequence of it is that a majority of the MSMEs may soon cease to exist, having been replaced by some of the other alternatives that we’ve discussed. It seems to be a never-ending circle where the ones who are making a profit out of this situation will continue to do so, while the others will be washed out from our collective memory.

The use of public transport has also led to the spread of COVID-19. On 23 January 2020, the entire Wuhan Metro network was shut down, along with all other public transport in the city, including national railway and air travel, to halt the spread of the virus. On January 24, 2020, the day after the lockdown declared in the city of Wuhan and the Beijing Subway began testing body temperature of passengers at the entry points of 55 subway stations including the three main railway stations and the capital airport. Temperature checks were expanded to all subway stations by January 27. To further control the spread of the virus, certain   trains were outfitted with smart surveillance cameras that can detect passengers who are not wearing masks. On 28 March 2020, six lines (Line 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7) resumed operation, after a two-month lockdown. Line 8, Line 11, and the Yangluo Line remain out of service. On 8 April 2020, Phase 1 of Line 8 resumed operation. Services on Phase 3 of Line 8, as well as Line 11 and the Yangluo Line, remain suspended. Various Indian states announced local and state-level partial and incremental transport shut down as early as March 11, 2020. India observed a complete lockdown including all trains, buses, airlines, cars, auto-rickshaw for 14 hours on March 22, 2020. A nationwide complete lockdown for three weeks (21 days) was then announced, beginning midnight March 25, 2020. Restrictions have been implemented to public transport in Jakarta, Indonesia. Transportation Ministry Greater Jakarta Transportation Agency (BPTJ) head Polana B Parsmati said that Jakarta in particular had initiated various restrictions including transportation restrictions in March. “After the official, large-scale social restrictions (PSBB) status it can be ascertained that public transportation user numbers have declined as people’s mobility has been limited,” she added. In the Philippines, public transportation has been suspended in Luzon as part of the implementing measures of the enhanced community quarantine. In the absence of public transport, citizens could only resort to private vehicles, but the critical role played by public transport cannot be replaced fully by private vehicles. On 20 March, free public transportation for people 65 years of age or older was temporarily suspended in Balıkesir, Konya, and Malatya to encourage them to stay at home. A day later, similar measures started to be imposed in Ankara, Antalya, and İzmir. On 24 March, it was announced that public transportation vehicles that work in and across the cities could fill up only 50% of their capacity with people at a time. Based on data released by Transit, France saw the largest decrease in the use of public transport. This included a 92 percent decrease in Lyon and an 85 percent decrease in Nice. France will make face masks compulsory on public transport when it starts easing its coronavirus lockdown on 11 May, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has said. Bus, plane, and train services were reduced in the United Kingdom. Public transport use has declined by around 90% in London since the national coronavirus lockdown was implemented. London’s mayor Sadiq Khan has made all bus travel free from Monday, April 20, and told passengers to the only board by the middle doors in a bid to protect bus drivers, after 20 of them died from the coronavirus. In Germany, where lockdown measures have already been lifted, it’s now mandatory to wear facemasks on public transport. Based on data released by Transit, demand for public transport in Canada dropped an average of 83 percent in late March compared to previous years. On March 17, the Edmonton Transit Service started using Saturday schedules for all of its routes 7 days a week. On April 1, Calgary Transit also reduced service. In Saskatoon, ridership had dropped by over 80 percent by March 30. Ridership on the Toronto Area’s two largest transit agencies – specifically Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) and GO Transit – had fallen 80 to 90 percent by April 13, and both had reduced service and/or suspended routes. The TTC and GO Transit have suspended the ability for customers to pay their fares with cash (or tokens in the case for TTC services) on their public transit buses until further notice. On April 14, TransLink said they were losing C$75 million per month and would need emergency funding or be forced to cut large amounts of local services. In Montreal, the Metro reported an 80 percent drop in ridership by March 26. In the northern suburb of Laval, the STL had cut 45 percent of local bus service. According to   “Steep declines in ridership during the crisis have pushed public transit systems across the U.S. into deep financial distress. Kim Hart of Axios wrote, “Public transit systems across the country are experiencing a painful trifecta Ridership has collapsed, funding streams are squeezed, and mass transit won’t bounce back from the pandemic nearly as fast as other modes of transportation. In Detroit, DDOT bus services were cancelled after drivers refused to work. reported an 18.65 percent ridership decline on the New York City Subway system for March 11 compared to one year prior. New York City Subway bus ridership decreased 15 percent, Long Island Rail Road ridership decreased 31 percent, and Metro-North Railroad ridership decreased 48 percent, Sound Transit, operating in the Seattle Metropolitan Area saw a 25 percent decrease in ridership in February compared to January, and the city’s ferry ridership saw a 15 percent decline on March 9 compared to one week prior.[37] These declines became much more pronounced in late March and April, as widespread closures of schools and businesses and ‘shelter-in-place’ orders began to be implemented. USA Today reported in mid-April that demand for transit service was down by an average of 75 percent nationwide, with figures of 85% in San Francisco and 60% in Philadelphia. Ridership on the Washington Metro was down 95 percent in late April. On April 7, SEPTA asked Philadelphia transit users to wear face masks starting on April 9. On April 13, the agency said the rule would not be enforced. In order to prevent the spread of the virus onboard buses and rail vehicles, some transit agencies have implemented temporary limits on the number of passengers allowed on a vehicle, and others have begun to require riders to wear face masks. To reduce contact between drivers and passengers, several agencies have implemented rear-door-only boarding and temporarily suspended the collection of fares,  examples including Seattle, New York City buses, and Denver. In California, Carson officials asked the Metro transit system to cease bus services in Los Angeles County. The San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) has reduced bus and Trolley services following ridership decreases. A vote on MTS’ proposal to expand public transit in San Diego may not be possible in 2020. Most services were shut down in San Francisco. Beginning March 25, service on buses and subways was reduced due to decreased ridership during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. In April 2020, four City Council members requested that the subway service be temporarily suspended due to the spread of COVID-19 in the subway system. In late March, NYCTA Interim President Sarah Feinberg stated that a shutdown “feels misguided to me” and was “not on the table”. Feinberg also spoke in favor of hazard pay for front-line workers. The following month, Feinberg called the MTA “the most aggressive transit agency in the country in acting quickly and decisively to protect our workforce. Starting in May 2020, stations were closed overnight for cleaning; the overnight closures would be a temporary measure that would be suspended once the pandemic was over. By April 22, 2020, COVID-19 had killed 83 agency employees; the agency announced that their families would be eligible for $500,000 in death benefits. By May 1, 98 transit workers had died. The use of public transportation during the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic has been implicated in spreading the disease; “researchers found that a bus passenger infected fellow travelers sitting 4.5 meters away”. A study published in the academic journal Practical Preventive Medicine found that “in a closed environment with air-conditioning, the transmission distance of the new coronavirus will exceed the commonly recognized safe distance. For some time, trams in Milan continued to function despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. As the virus is spread from person to person, “one of the most common ways is through public and semi-private transport.” In Israel, one rider who was a carrier of the coronavirus was apprehended “on a bus on its way to Jerusalem, on suspicion of deliberately spreading the disease.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/online-gaming-adolescent-online-gaming-effects-demotivated-depression-musculoskeletal-and-psychosomatic-symptoms/", "title": "Online gaming: Adolescent online gaming effects demotivated, depression, musculoskeletal, and psychosomatic symptoms. | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "A video game is any software program that can be played on a computing device, such as a personal computer, gaming console, or mobile device. Video games have been in existence since the early 1970s and have become increasingly popular, spanning different mobile (smartphones, tablets) and stationary (computer or console) platforms. Advances, particularly in mobile devices, have given birth to social networks and group gaming Although the nature of gaming does not require physical stamina and therefore is not limited by factors such as age, gender, or fitness, it is most popular with adolescents. In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) classified gaming disorder in their International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). The ICD-11 is a list of diseases and medical conditions that aids health professionals in making diagnoses and treatment plans for patients having various disorders. It should be noted that, the inclusion of gaming disorder in the ICD-11 by WHO has generated vigorous and sometimes contentious debate and discussion within the medical and mental health community. Although recognized as an area of clinical interest, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) published by the American Psychiatric Association suggests that more clinical research is required before Gaming Disorder is formally considered as a psychiatric disorder. Similarly, the WHO notes the inclusion of gaming disorder in ICD-11, to encourage more research into excessive gaming behavior, including its prevention and treatment. 2018 WHO draft 11th Revision of the ICD-11 denotes the disorder as a pattern of “digital-gaming” or “video-gaming” behavior characterized by impaired control over gaming activity, increasing priority given to gaming over other activities to the extent that gaming takes precedence over other interests and daily activities, and the continuation or escalation of gaming despite the occurrence of negative consequences. Online Gaming disorder has the same similarities with Internet gaming disorder (IGD), which is a condition that the American Psychiatric Association (APA) noted in DSM-5 as an area in need of additional study. The APA does not currently recognize IGD as an official condition. For gaming disorder to be diagnosed, the WHO criteria require that the behavioral pattern of the gamer must be of sufficient severity that major and noticeable impairment and deterioration in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning is present for a minimum of 12 months. According to the WHO definition, a person with online gaming disorder will demonstrate the following characteristics for at least 12 months; problems controlling control their gaming habits, seeing gaming as more important over other necessities and daily activities or work, continuing to engage in gaming even after its negative health and social problems has been identified or are evident. Further research shows that gaming disorders can also be linked to anxiety, depression, obesity, sleeping disorders, and stress. People who remain physically inactive for long periods because of gaming may also be at higher risk of obesity, sleep disorders, and other health-related issues, according to WHO [1]. Video game-related health problems can cause continuous strain injuries, skin disorders, and other health issues. Other problems according to Shoja et al. (2007), include a condition that could be termed video game-provoked seizures in patients with pre-existing epilepsy. The following health consequences of video gaming have been reported. Video game playing is associated with eye problems. Extensive and fixed staring at a video game screen causes eyestrain because the cornea, pupil, and iris are not biologically equipped for chronic heavy viewing of digital images from electronic devices. The visual system strain from frequent video game use over extended periods may result in headaches, dizziness, and in some cases, nausea and vomiting. Interestingly, there is some research that shows that gamers have an enhancement of spatial distribution of attention, compared with non-gamers. This somewhat predictable practice effect occurs with both peripheral and central visual attention. For sufferers of amblyopia (dimness or blurring of the eyesight due to a fault in transmission from the eye to the brain) video games may be helpful. Persistent gamers may also suffer from musculoskeletal problems. A survey of children indicated increased physical complaints associated with video game playing. Such complaints range from pain in the hands and wrists to back and neck. Furthermore, a case report involving a nine-year-old teenager referenced Playstation thumb. Playstation thumb is, characterized by numbness and a blister is caused by friction between the thumb and the controller from rapid and persistent gameplay. Using dermoscopy, dermatologists discovered hemorrhages and onycholysis (the loosening or separation of a fingernail) in a patient who presented with hyperkeratosis. Also, tendon injuries (tendinosis) of the hands and wrists from tendon overuse, is another health problem associated with video game playing. Furthermore, another case report in the New England Journal of Medicine reported a fracture of the base of the fifth metatarsal from people who play Wii video games. This condition has been termed (perhaps sarcastically), a Wii fracture. There are also postural problems associated with the persistent playing of video games, although, ergonomic measures (including chair to monitor position) could potentially improve postural problems associated with video game playing. Playing video games consistently has been associated with obesity. This is maybe related to the lack of physical activity in players. Alternatively, it could be that those who are less physically fit because of obesity gravitate towards less physically demanding activities, such as gaming. In either case, several studies have linked television and video games and increased Body Mass Index (BMI). It has been estimated that children in the United States spend 25% of their waking hours watching either television or playing video games. Furthermore, children who watch the most hours of television or play video games have the highest incidence of obesity. If video games are replacing physical activities and young people do not participate in physical recreation or see playing of video games as a form of recreation, this may be part of the link between times spent while playing video games and a rise in BMI in teenagers. Evidence for this potential link gains some support from a German study reporting that boys who spend no more than 1.5 hours per day engaged in television watching or playing video games, were 75.4% less likely to be overweight than those who spend more than 1.5 hours engaged in the same activity. In a 2011 study, an association between video game activity and an increase of (mostly junk) food intake was reported. Specifically, single video game sessions caused an increase in food intake, regardless of appetite. It has also been suggested that active video game play using two popular gaming platforms has the opposite effect. Other researchers found no evidence that more active video games would result in a beneficial outcome although the study did demonstrate an increase in the amount of physical activity within the children receiving the active video games. Health concerns   may cause epileptic seizures started in the early 1980s. The first medically documented case of a video game-induced seizure was reported in 1981. In 1993, a story in the popular press (Sun newspaper) reported that a boy choked to death on his own vomit during a seizure triggered by playing a video game. Similar but less serious incidents were subsequently reported by news media around the world, ultimately motivating video game console manufacturers to include that epilepsy warnings in the instruction manuals for their gaming products. In 1994 it was reported that video games only cause seizures in people already predisposed to epilepsy and advised that people with a predisposition to epilepsy can greatly reduce the risk of a seizure by staying 10 feet or more away from the TV set and wearing sunglasses while playing video games. This is clearly an area in need of additional research. The cost: benefit value of prevention versus treatment of addiction disorders has been known for many years. It is important and beneficial to make use of several types of strategies in combating gaming addictiveness or disorder. Effective strategies include: educating gamers about gaming behaviors and consequences on their mental health; treatment geared towards helping the gamer to control his/her urge for video games, recognizing and dealing with disturbing thoughts and learning how to cope without video games; intrapersonal and interpersonal counseling to help gamers to explore their identity, build self-esteem, and enhance their emotional intelligence outside the fictional world of gaming and learning communication and assertiveness skills needed in social interactions; family involvement, including counseling and discussion family and other relationships; and developing new lifestyles. The latter is particularly important and to paraphrase the well-known mantra of Alcoholics Anonymous, it’s all about, people, places, and things. To prevent the persistent playing of video games, people need to explore new activities, set new goals and metrics of achievements beyond video game scores.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/how-the-covid-19-crisis-is-redefining-jobs-and-services/", "title": "How the COVID-19 crisis is redefining jobs and services? | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "The pandemic has shaken the world in the way one had hardly imagined. The impact of it on Jobs and Services is going to be long-lasting and it will be the foundation stone of revolution in these sectors. With the work from home and social distancing norms is altering the way of work, the way we interact, what work we will do, how the work will be done, and whatnot. To just give an example, in the middle of the first lockdown, FMCG major Hindustan Unilever (HUL) went ahead with its merger. It took place online entirely. Yes, it took place online. Who could have ever imagined the merger can take place online? Change is inevitable. But some changes are temporary and some are permanent. The pandemic is bringing changes that are going to be permanent. In fact, these changes were due for a long time and we’re coming at a slow pace. What the pandemic has done is, it has become the catalyst for these changes and raised the ante for change. So, what exactly the changes will be? Let’s look at them one by one. The first change is going to be the extensive use of digital communication from now onwards. The Zoom, Jio Meet, Google Meet, and some derivatives like these are going to be the forever meeting rooms where the important discussions will be held. This may be bad news for the employees who are older than 40 years. They would not have pictured themselves doing such transformation at this part of life. Experts believe that the new normal in the offices are going to be hierarchy-less. The older employees would have to work with the younger ones. There would be no geographical boundaries and where the communication and software adaptability among employees is going to be crucial. The symbol of power will be less visible and the decentralization of power in the office will be prominent. There will be more egalitarianism in companies. The corporates will think much more about office space. Rather than expending too much on physical infrastructure, the online infrastructure will always be in their hindsight. The impact would be more prudent in small and mid-sized businesses. The physical offices itself might disappear from such businesses. But it’s not going to be easy for companies. The security and confidentiality of the authentic information going out of the offices’ building are going to be the largest concern in the new normal world. There would be no surprise if a lot of start-ups will bloom in the near future providing software for security for the data and information of the companies. Also, travel is going to be reduced. So, the major component of CTC where the companies fooling the employees must find the other way. The second change is going to be struck down on employees. Already many of the companies and start-ups are reducing the workforce. It is expected that new normal offices would work with an 80% workforce of that of the current workforce. Automation is on the verge. Due to safety reasons, the companies are going to be more and more leaned towards automation with a minimal touch of human possible. This might result in a loss of jobs in some sectors, but it will also create new jobs in the automation sector. It was evident from before pandemic too but now the velocity for the same would be increased. In the new normal tech-enabled world, the job which would be at stake dominantly would be managers’ managers. The IT firms have started firing the vice presidents and assistant vice presidents who draw hefty salaries but don’t really drive the business. In the designation-less set up in the near future accelerated by Pandemic, they automatically become redundant. For the first time, the employees might be given jobs that would require more than the standard jobs. Also, when the workforce in the company would be less in the company, the employees might be given the option of working for extra time or working on the weekends and would be incentivized for the same rather than employing more staff and paying them full salary. It is a win-win situation for both employees and companies. Employees can earn more than what they usually earn and will get to learn new which would be out of their primary domain. The companies would be able to keep their costs low through this. The assessment of employees might change too. Rather than going for an annual performance review, the employees might be evaluated based on the tasks they perform. Creativity and innovation are going to be swords for the employees in the new normal world rather than designations in the office.   The other change might be in the services sector. The services like which involves maximum human touch will be the one which will be affected most adversely. The safety concerns and confidence of people over the system are going to be the issue for at least the next few years. It also opens the opportunity for something very new. The products which could replace the need for visiting such services centers are going to create a boom in the market. According to McKinsey, the sales for such products are multiplying rapidly. There are speculations that the economies will tend to become Minimalist economies. Let’s dig deep into this. Minimalist economies are the economies where people tend to refrain from purchasing luxurious items and focuses on purchasing necessities more and more.  Well, this is the position we are in right now during the pandemic. People are expensing only necessary items like groceries and the demand for luxurious items is way below average. But it would be hard to stay the same as this. The minimalist economy will result in the deterioration of the economy in the short term. It is true that in the minimalist economy the demand might be low, but it would be wrong to assume the demand will be zero. The high-quality products will gather the attention of the purchasers. It is evident from past experiences that the economy always finds its way to come back from the mode of minimalist economy. Though this time may take some time, it will surely return on track. But every trouble comes with an opportunity. This is the time for the companies to act now and grab the opportunities the pandemic has brought with him. But for that companies are required to follow plans, formulate strategies to suit their needs, and pay more attention to the innovation. The companies must form plans for the five stages from here. These stages are 5Rs: Resolve, Resilience, Return, Reimagination, and Reform.  In the resolve phase companies need to formulate a nerve center to combat Corvid itself. The tendency of the company should not be like that, they will return only after everything becomes normal. In most parts of the country, permission is granted to the companies for their operations. If they wait for normalcy, then bankruptcy might catch them before the normalcy. The resilience phase includes maintaining liquidity, addressing solvency, and grow for sustainability. All businesses should know when their cash crunch is coming. Addressing these cash crunches will be crucial for the companies. Businesses must take aggressive options to remain solvent. For example, the businesses might have cash in their hand but might be poor in operational efficiency then it requires the attention of the company. Organizations solving issues of liquidity and solvency will be in a better position to grow with sustainability. In the third phase of return the companies will have to plan for the time when everything will be back on track. Given the possibility of subsequent waves of coronavirus the companies need new ways of working to prevent, identify, report, and contain future flareups. Many industries will face this problem of returning. Staying prepared for resurgence scenarios should include a multi-scenario modeling exercise. Reverting to non-COVID-19 care will require extensive planning and market testing. The phase of reimagining will include the learnings from the pandemic. A small virus and the whole economy at the toss. The businesses will have to introspect them and must look for advancements in technologies such that this kind of pandemic in the future will not disturb their efficiency too much. The pandemic has taught us that the decision which took weeks and months in the normal world can be accelerated and can be taken in some days. This should become a permanent feature. Cross organizational collaboration has become much easier. This should stay in the long run. The last phase is the reform. In this phase, the companies should look at their bottlenecks and try to fix them. Also, the companies will have to reconsider their relationship with their customers. The confidence in their brands, they must regain it. There are three ways to shift work, talent, and skills to where and when they are needed most, thereby building the organizational resilience and agility necessary to navigate uncertain times and rebound with strength when the economy recovers. In this dismal situation it is more important than ever most of the staff should be in the critical tasks. The tasks could be like the customer complaints redressal. We know that the customers are the ones who make the businesses successful. Thus, retaining their confidence is the utmost priority. The organizations can convert some of the staff to address the queries and concerns of customers. The organizations require to create virtual offices. There should not be the geographical boundaries within the organization. The employees from all over the world from the organization should come together and take the organization back to pre-corvid state. By breaking out of rigid job constraints, the right talent and work can be matched to solve evolving business challenges in real-time. This was happening before the pandemic too. But accelerating it with pace has now become the need of the hour. The perception that automation is a job-killer is totally wrong and in fact, it is the mandatory capability to deal with the crisis. Organizations can increase automation in call centers. This will reduce the response time. Temporarily moving employees from some industries like airlines, restaurants, hospitality can be moved to those organizations which have maximum work at this time like healthcare and logistics. To conclude, the companies should understand “Lives come first, but livelihood matters”. The pandemic will have some adverse effects on jobs and services, but this is not the end. The pandemic has brought many opportunities with him and if they are grabbed then the organizations would be in much better position even compared to pre-corvid situations. The companies need to understand the pandemic is not going to be forever. The last concluding sentence will be corona will bring changes but there will not be a revolution in jobs and services.

Organization wants to track some KPIs based on the given monthly target and tracking should be department wise or technician wise. The dashboard will show tracking the pace of KPIs so that they can understand how the organization is performing in each department in terms of number of jobs, revenue etc and also they want to understand  how technicians are working to achieve their monthly target. Dashboard has two basic views – one for admin persons and one for users only. When an admin person logged in to the web app he will see the dashboard as an iframe and he can filter date range, department, technician to see the progress of department and technicians. When a user logged in to the web app he will see the user dashboard view after  auto-filtering his name so that he can only view his data in the dashboard. Scope of this project is limited to AtoZ Dependable Service but scaleable to auto user filter in dashboard datasource. Each user will see his data only in the dashboard that brings data security and integrity. Define attributes and entities that needed to determine all the KPIs for tracking Group KPIs in categories and subcategories. For example- as per work defined in organization can be divided into three main categories called Service, Sales and Install. And each of these categories can be divided into 5 departments called- Drain, BATH, HVAC, plumbing and excavation. So any department will have the same KPIs for the same  category.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/difference-between-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-statistics-and-data-mining/", "title": "What is the difference between Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Statistics, and Data Mining? | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "“Data is the new oil” has become the most important trendline of the 21  century. The reason for this is the advancements in the fields related to data analysis. The field of AI Machine Learning Statistics and Data Mining all deal with data and are developing at such a staggering pace, that these fields have become the most popular buzzwords these days. Buzzwords are originated through technical terms but often the underlying essence is ignored through fashionable use and mainly used to impress. This is the main reason for the misconception amongst people. AI, ML, Stats, Data Mining, and many other fields related to the analysis of data are most often mistook for one and the same thing, thus all these words are often used interchangeably to convey one and the same thing. But this is not true at all! The only similarity between these disciplines is that all of these disciplines are related to the analysis of the data and converting this data into “information”. In academics, while learning AI Machine Learning Statistics and Data Mining, the academic approach only wander in the technical definitions and concepts but the underlying essence and the aim of the discipline remain unexplored, same is the case with most of the articles out there which try to explain the difference. Thus, becoming the primary cause of confusion between learners. Hence, this article explains the difference by explaining the philosophy and the aims of each of the disciplines rather than wandering in the technical definitions. The essential difference between these disciplines lies in their “aims” and the approach taken to achieve those aims. The aim of Artificial intelligence is to understand intelligent entities. Then to satisfy this aim, we must first understand what is intelligence and what makes an agent intelligent agent? The answer to all these questions can be found by studying intelligent agents and the best example of an intelligent agent can be found by just standing in front of a mirror! Yes! Humans are the best examples of intelligent entities. Thus, in the 1900s, researchers began exploring the thought process, the reasoning process of humans as human beings were considered as an ideal intelligent agent. Mimicking human behavior became the aim of AI in the initial years of the research. After setting this goal, studies and experiments began and the most famous experiment conducted in the initial years to achieve this aim was the Turing Test! Turing defined intelligent behavior as the ability to achieve human-level performance in all cognitive tasks, sufficient to fool an interrogator. But this test received criticism as only mimicking human behavior is not exactly intelligence. Because intelligence should be related to the working of the human brain as without the human brain, intelligence has no meaning!             Thus, mimicking human thought processes and reasoning became the transformed aim. The field of Psychology and philosophy also resonate with this aim that is to understand the human thought process. The difference is that AI not only tries to understand the thought process but to mimic it, build it. The collaboration of these fields resulted in models such as Neural Networks which try to mimic the function of neurons present in the human brain. So, basically, this initial aim was human-centered and humans were considered as the ideal intelligent agent. Concurrently, the field of computer science was developing at a greater pace. With the advances in computer science, the experiments and theories could be easily tested and validated. As programs were being applied to solve real-life problems, it was found that computers performed better than humans at some tasks that are really complex for humans. One of the best examples of this could be the chess-playing program. An AI program defeated the world’s best chess player Garry Kasparov. This incident indicated that human intelligence is not the ultimate intelligence or else a human would have been able to defeat the AI program. This leads to a question, is human intelligence the ideal intelligence? As computers became more advanced, they proved to be better than humans at certain complex tasks. That is why the   was being related to the ability to solve cognitive tasks or problems. So, rather than considering the nature of agents, researchers began to study the nature of intelligence itself. Then the question comes how to test or validate intelligence? The best way to test intelligence is to solve cognitive problems. An agent can be said intelligent only if it can solve a complex problem. The problem-solving approach can be easily tested and validated on computers. Thus, some researchers began studying the ideal intelligence, and the selected agent to validate the experiments was the computer. So, a computer and problem-solving approach were adopted. So, the human-centered approach and computer, problem-solving approach are the two main aims of AI. Both of these fields have contributed to the field by giving valuable insights. Both the aims are important and both of these collaboratively form the main aim of AI! In the problem-solving approach, there is a big challenge that AI has to overcome in order to achieve its aim. Consider the example of solving a math problem. There are two cases by which intelligence can be tested in this problem-solving approach. Let us say two math problems are given for you to solve. The first problem is familiar to you and the second problem is not. Consider the first problem. The first problem is familiar to you, that means you know how to solve such kind of problems as you have already solved some similar problems in the past. So, there comes a question, how our mind is able to solve that problem? The answer is, that you have solved similar problems in the past, thus you have learned from the past data, how to solve such problems, thus even if you haven’t seen that problem in the past, you will still be able to solve similar problems. This is one form of intelligence. Consider another case where you are given a second problem where you have not solved such kind of problems in the past. Then to solve this problem, you will try to consciously gather and manipulate the given information so that you reach a certain conclusion. This kind of approach does not necessarily rely on the past data but completely on the reasoning process. This is the second kind of intelligence. For AI to build intelligent agents, both of these kinds of intelligence must be developed in the agent. But, the reality is that AI has reached the point where it is able to build agents which can only learn from past data and find some useful information. AI today has not reached a point where it can build agents who can think on their own. That is the second type of intelligence. So, the way AI is able to implement the first type of intelligence is through Machine Learning! So, the domain of AI which focuses solely on implementing the first kind of intelligence is in fact Machine Learning. That is the reason why ML is called the subset of AI! So, this is the main difference between AI and ML. Technically speaking, “It is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn from past data and find some meaningful conclusions, patterns without being explicitly programmed”. This statement needs some elaboration. The essence of ML is related to the process of “Generalization” and learning from past data. Generalization is an abstraction by which common properties of specific instances are formulated as general concepts or claims. Consider how we humans recognize daily life objects. If we see an animal, then we can easily recognize if it is a “dog” or a “cat”. It is a very trivial task for us but have you ever wondered how our mind is able to do it? The answer is Generalization! If you were given a picture of a dog, you can easily recognize that it is a picture of a dog, because, our minds have abstracted the description of a dog and formulated it into a “concept” of what a dog is and these concepts became better and better as we learned from the past experiences of a dog. So, the way we think is dependent on the fact that things are represented as generalized concepts in our minds. With generalization only, can come real “information”. So, we try to give computers the ability to generalize the “raw data” and convert it into “information” which can be patterns and trends in the data on their own. This is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. Statistics tries to deal with data with the only aim that is to explain it. So, it is the study of explaining the data itself! Statistics has two main domains which are Descriptive statistics and Inferential statistics.  deals with the explanation or description of data thus the name “Descriptive” statistics. It tries to explain as much information as possible, easily about the whole large data which would be a very complex task otherwise.  Inferential statistics try to make accurate inferences from the available small data. We use inference in many tasks in our daily lives. Consider a simple case of cooking a soup. After completing the recipe, you will taste a small sample, that is, a spoonful of the soup to check if the soup tastes good or bad. Depending upon the result of the sample, you make an inference about the whole soup that if the soup as a whole, good or bad. Similarly, in statistics, there are cases where you have to apply inference to have meaningful information. For example, consider a case where you cannot gather the whole data because it is very time-consuming and costly. In these cases, applying inference based on the available sample introduces uncertainty. That is where inferential statistics come for help. So, the use of data in the context of uncertainty and decision-making in the face of uncertainty is what statistics deals with. So, however, and whatever the data, statistics tries to explain that data. This aim does not resonate with that of AI and ML, but statistics help  ! “Data”, is not useful at all in its raw form. Consider examples of sensors used in industrial applications. These sensors might be used in a manufacturing plant to sense different properties like temperature, pressure, etc. The raw data generated by these sensors are not useful until and unless it is converted to a suitable form, then processed, analyzed to gather valuable insights, which can be used to solve a problem! Due to its unique aim of capturing the essence of very large datasets, to gather insights, Data Mining is also referred to as “Knowledge Discovery”. That is why, Carly Fiorina, former CEO of Hewlett-Packard once said, “The goal is to turn data into information and information into Insight”. This statement completely explains the aim of Data Mining!             So, the difference between AI Machine Learning Statistics and Data Mining lies in their aims. But the approaches taken in all of these fields, help in one way or the other in fulfilling the aims of the other fields. This is the beauty of these fields!

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/how-voice-search-makes-your-business-a-successful-business/", "title": "How Voice search makes your business a successful business. | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "Finding ways to make using the Internet easier is something most modern consumers are passionate about. Since the rise of AI-infused technology like Amazon’s Alexa or Apple’s Siri, voice search has grown increasingly popular. In fact, nearly 60 percent of people all over the world use voice search at least once a day. As this technology grows more popular and complex with each passing day, business owners are starting to take notice of voice search. Capitalizing on this trend is only possible when optimizing the content on your website for voice search. Are you trying to make your website more voice search-friendly? If so, check out the following tips. In the past, if you wanted relevant answers from a voice recognition technology, well—good luck with that. But today, machine learning systems can compete with people in terms of accuracy. Google’s voice recognition, Google is now able to understand human language with 95 percent accuracy These improvements mean that, while you can trust good voice systems to match customers with the right products, services, or information with increasing degrees of nuance, leading businesses already have set customer expectations for delivery. Thanks to machine learning algorithms that can detect speech and respond with meaningful results. Because voice search systems are at a point where they actually can perform reliably and meet customer expectations just as well (if not better) than traditional query options, customer trust in them is growing: Yet, only 4% of businesses are properly optimized for voice search. What’s with the disconnect? In other words, business leaders are at an ideal intersection where reliable systems are available and there are still many customers who haven’t been reached or who might want more out of the systems they currently use. Bringing those systems and customers together will help companies avoid being left behind. When people use voice search, they don’t just want to locate a great pair of shoes or a TV. People want all kinds of other information, such as your store hours, how to connect to support specialists, and when you’re having your next sale. This is partly why some experts have predicted a “totally different internet” within the next five to 10 years, one where voice-activated chatbots have all but replaced the e-commerce channels we’re used to using.  Shoppers are also after general tips that can take some of the friction out of everyday life—think life hacks and how-tos. In fact, words like “how,” “what,” “best,” and “easy” are among the top voice search queries. This means that when it comes to online marketing, you probably need to change your entire optimization approach, taking elements like grammar and semantics, the structure of your site, and structured data markup that influences Google’s ability to find your content. Of course, optimizing from the start, not as an afterthought, is ideal. Voice Search can be used on both desktop and mobile searches. We can see that customers want different types of information from voice systems, they also can use it at many points in the customer journey. For example, about half of shoppers use voice to research products, even “near me” searches results are mostly done by customers. Customers also use voice to: These statistics show you should think beyond just having customers find you or your products. Voice search and commands can take your buyers from start to finish, so give your customers as much convenience and satisfaction as possible by integrating voice options into more types of interactions. A survey showed that, once a consumer makes a local voice search, their next most common action is to call the business (28%). Customers also are highly likely to visit company websites (27%), show up at the company’s location (19%), and do more research into that business or additional businesses (14% and 12%, respectively). So, in short, while voice services can allow a customer to complete many steps without human interaction, you shouldn’t see it as a total substitute. Many people are going to take further steps after the initial search, and they still will want to hear a human voice respond back once in a while. They are going to have more questions, and they’re willing to physically connect with you and what you offer. Don’t drop the ball in other areas, like making your site aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate, having enough staff ready to chat, listing an accurate contact number, or keeping your store well-stocked. Voice search already is shifting the way customers engage with brands, but there’s still time for companies of any size to get involved with voice systems in ways that can benefit both the customer and the business’s bottom line. The next step is to find voice search solutions. However, as with other technologies, these are not necessarily one size fits all, meaning it’s critical to shop around and be specific about your goals. If you can customize and update your options in a scalable way, they’ll be even more effective for your business.

In an era where the cliché “Change is the only constant” is relevant more than ever, people are looking at Big Data and Analytics to make their decisions more data-driven. Big Data is evolving into a necessity for the business not just to analyze and predict future outcomes but also to create and shape them. It is slowly becoming the oxygen for a company and the company’s survival, in the long run, might depend on its effectiveness in using big data. Humans are not the best at expressing their needs. Some human needs are so latent that people don’t even realize their existence. Thankfully, we no longer have to rely only on questionnaires and interviews for data collection. Collecting customers’ preferences through their online behavioral pattern and analyzing them can provide much better results. This can be used to take the level of customization a customer experiences to a whole new level. Big Data provides insights into the decision journey of an individual before buying a product. The marketing team can identify the key features in the product that attract the customers. It is also indispensable in understanding the local markets and helps in coming up with marketing strategies at regional levels. Customers nowadays don’t want products pushed to them and would rather prefer buying stuff at their convenience. Thus, it has become necessary that a high degree of customization and accuracy is required while marketing products to customers. Whether a person is your customer or not may depend on that first product you recommend to him. Equally important is the appropriate pricing of the product. Big Data analytics can help in determining the ideal price of the product. It can also provide insights into the possibility of differentiated pricing of products based on the customer’s willingness to pay. Big Data can be used to leverage the Next Best Alternative (NBA) marketing approach. This is a customer-centric approach wherein unique, real-time promotional offers for a customer are considered and the optimal one is determined. This is radically different from the traditional approach of creating offers for the product first and then attempting to prospect. Big Data and Analytics can also help in brand management by analyzing customer reviews/comments over a period of time. This is one of the best ways to identify customer’s expectation from the product. The reason for any sharp change in the level of overall satisfaction must be analyzed. Tangentially, it can also be used to identify new potential markets and facilitate product diversification. Forrester reveals that big data and analytics are being used by 44% of B2C marketers to improve responsiveness and that 36% actively use analytics and data mining for better forecasting. Given how young the field of big data is, these are astounding figures. Data, which were once qualitative (Weight – Slim, Fit, Fat) have become quantitative (kgs, lbs) with the advancement in technology (the invention of the weighing machine). We are in a similar transitional phase in the way we market and sell goods. Analytics provides ways of quantifying marketing decision, which can come in handy while recording, organizing, justifying and learning from our previous decisions. Some of the ways in which we can augment our marketing decisions with analytics are listed below.   Predictive analytics has also brought about disruption in the job market. Analytical skills and tools are becoming necessary to run a business and hence the marketing team must be equipped with knowledge of the same. In view of these changes, here are a few things that marketing leaders can do to build a big data and analytics centric marketing team: The best thing about Data Analytics is that it is helpful for organizations of all scales. For most smaller organizations, investment in predictive analytics holds the key for rapid expansion. Large, established organizations also use analytics to understand trends in the market. Though several technologies have sprung up in the past before becoming irrelevant, predictive analytics doesn’t seem like yet another one of those. Judging by how essential it has become to all scales of business, predictive analytics is here to stay for a very long time! Investing in them and building an organization centered around analytics would be a wise decision.   \n \n We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

Those connected assets are the reservoir, vending machines, truck carriers, roof sheds, etc. The idea is to improve productivity and reduce costs through predictive maintenance and data insights. In all these, sensors are to be attached to provide real-time data for analysis. Sensors like – environment sensors are also to be attached to know weather conditions, temperature, pressure, etc. To monitor these assets satellite imagery may also be used. There shall be video streaming also to understand the environment.  Future asset problems may be predicted to reduce downtime and efficiency improvement. Dust is one of the important challenges that have to be monitored in a service station. The well-coordinated system has to be maintained among assets for maximum productivity. The only improvement in productively and cost reduction can contribute to a higher margin. The neglected part has to be pointed out and it has to be also managed through our software. All the assets are to be in synchronization for productivity improvement. Any anomaly or defect in machines is to be also pointed out or detected in real-time. Not only among machines or assets of the operator but other operator’s machines and assets may also be connected for a comparative perspective and to understand the competitive advantage.  In the machine connection, we will enable network devices to exchange information and perform actions without the manual assistance of people in the service station. It would be managed by technology with some of the parts of the machine be automated.  There shall be a central point for analysis by integrating sensors, the internet, and computers. The asset connection has to be strategic to achieve the purpose of productivity improvement, cost reduction, operation speed, hyper-digital orientation, and to help large scale businesses with accurate prediction or output for decision making. Various new insights are to be drawn to take action for a profitable business. Machine connection will monitor the critical infrastructure of service stations with minimum people intervention. It will also monitor service station traffic in real-time. The sensors are to be of high quality. These sensors can send details about pressure, flow rate, temperature, moisture content, and even fuel levels and inventory. Traffic volume and speed have to be monitored by using control devices like lights and information signs. Using the incoming data, the software will maximize traffic speed and other vehicles operating in a service station.  Energy efficiency is another aspect in the service station and it has to be monitored through our software. Our central hub has to dispatch data to the owner or person in- charge’s mobile or wearable in real-time. It will consume less power and here both consumers and suppliers will be benefitted by getting the information.  For our central hub, to identify and to keep the data record, all the incoming vehicle to service station be identified with their vehicle number with an ID, and that may be of use for new business purposes. There shall be also automatic counting of how many two-wheelers, four-wheelers get fuel filled or any other. How many times at a time liquid did flow, that reading will be studied for business transformation and scale purpose. How many smart petrol cards users are there in your area are to be studied. There shall be monitoring and update of digital billboard about service station business activity and other, and on pricing, and events. Our predictive e-maintenance should provide Optimization, prediction, clustering, classification, benchmarking and so on. The machine synchronization module will connect to other departments of operation speed, business transformation, and business scale.   For health management of service station, there shall be a) service station clustering with similar machines for sound comparison, and b) local cluster fault detection to evaluate the similarity of individual machines. Here, the global model may not work but there shall be information sharing among local clusters for better health of service station through our service hub. By leveraging data generated from other similar service stations, the problem or fault detection can be done in a service station and it may have a comparison to the other three departments in a broader sense. Critical model parameters like training samples, components, and alarming limits set are the same for all the units regardless of their different functionalities.  But, sometimes false alert discourages the user. However, this peer to peer comparison methodology inside a machine network could improve the fault detection accuracy significantly.   Harvesting of values from machines/assets also needs a redesign of the service station. For example, the location may reach both sides of the road despite the facility is in one side.  Speed is understood as money for industries. Without speed in operation, a service station will lose competitiveness and money. The profit of the service station depends on speed. Operation speed in the service station can be achieved by well-integrated assets. The long queue in the service station has to be managed for speed operation. Any safety-related issue has to be attached to preventive and predictive maintenance and safety guidelines. For speed operation trend and patterns has to be studied. Video streaming and satellite imagery have to be given importance. Distance and time factors are to be attached to analysis for speed. Hyper awareness to market is important for speed in operation. Human and financial resources are to be also attached to speed. Hyper awareness of the environment also required for speed. Hour, week, fortnight, month, year calculation on different factors are to be attached beforehand to develop speed. Policy, guidelines, law have to be properly understood. All assets are to be attached to an operation speed. You should also attach to other vendors of your area and different area, for uncertainty management. You develop positive enthusiasm in your operation so that speed can be developed. Operation speed can be achieved through efficient use of the supply chain. Information management is another aspect of speed. You should have a good infrastructure with no potholes nearby.   The design speed of a service station related to its machine connection, business transformation and scale. The highest design speed of a service station is the design speed of its least favorite part.  This speed also corresponds to strategic speed. The design speed is determined by the capability of the owner. This speed of operation changes with urban and local settings. The owner should have a targeted speed- how much he needs to sell per month, week, day and hour. When things are calculated in hour speed is higher than the design speed. The design speed may be influenced by – asset design of service station, planned operating speed, legislated speed limit caps, anticipated traffic volumes, the service station’s functional classification. The speed of safety is the main idea of a petrol pump.   Perception reaction time PRT and maneuver reaction time MRT applies to stop in operation and transform for new speed. A collision of any kind be avoided in speed operation. Reaction time is minimized for a quick decision. The yellow range is where the service station operates smoothly, next is the abrupt control movement, and the last is v line which is not to be exceeded.  How to deliver more services with less time without consuming the time of the customers is also important.  You want business transformation in the digital age. Let you digitize everything in operation and capture the new opportunities in your field and expand your business to a new area. What is the new business area that can be attached to your existing service station business? What is happening around the globe? What is the specialty of your area and what is the gap in your area in business? What new business value you can offer to the local community? You can attach your business to other businesses and brands of your area and outside your area. You attach to the gas business, you attach to an electric charging machine before anybody does it. You should have hyper-awareness to transformative market. Use technology to understand this transformation in real-time around another part of the country and the globe. Sustained delivery of goods and services to customers with low cost and big experience rather than the brand has become an important priority.   In a shifting market, there shall be a fundamental shift in the way business conducted in a service station. Technology has to be used for profit. Otherwise, the operator will be in loss and to fulfill this loss they may radically hamper the business environment. Business transformation is caused by external changes in the market such as changes in organization’s old product or services, funding or income streams being changed, new regulations coming into force or market competition become more intense. In the case of the service station, new GST would make a market impact, the further market is moving towards digitization. It is necessary for productivity improvement, customer satisfaction, and cost reduction. There shall be realigning in staff, structure, core product and service portfolio, through the introduction of digital technology. Is there any shift in the consumer base? What kind of business perspective projection available for a particular service station? All these can be provided on a real-time basis from our services hub. Only doing business does not yield a profit if you are not applying scale in quantitative terms. For that,  you have to have speed in operation. How much you are selling and how much you should sell, so that you will have a higher margin. Where do you need to expand in business, and how and when. What are the new areas and in which area you can move faster to catch upscale? The business scale is also related to your quality services. Learn different quality services in different petrol pumps in the world.  What is your peripheral area that should not collide with others? What type of service station you are and to whom you need to associate with is the idea behind the business scale.  What are the intangible/invisible assets of a petrol station? Can we derive wealth or value from it? Different locations have different invisible assets.   Long term sale contracts are important as well as multiple revenue streams. There shall be a high business return from all the strategic assets and high business margins from selling products. Identify intangible assets – patent, etc from partnering with a local institution, create a business that has the potential to be expanded, expand market by offering product or services to a wider section of an existing market or to a new demographic, psychographic or geographic market. Develop a brand of your services through company brand value, tagline or by new research. Give customers innovative experiences.   Create demand or desirability for your goods and services, create the ability of customers to pay for your goods and services, create uniqueness and competitiveness of your business model, control the quality of your products and services. Finally, you create public regard for your business as a member of the community.

Develop , deploy and maintain the system in the background, and there will be more hospitals partnering with our organization utilizing this tool per our service offering, which could lead to long-term working contracts with us, if interested. The current project is a HIPPA-compliant SPA Web Application that will interface with hospital data dashboards involving discharged patients. Call-Navigator utilizes an SFTP server that is hosted in AWS, this allows our partner hospital to store patient discharge files directly to an S3 bucket. The application and dashboard are currently up and running and pulling information and data from our partner hospital. However, the project was rushed through initial development and there are several front-end features that need to be addressed (or fine-tuned/upgraded) and functions added (search/flag options and redirection) to make the application more user-friendly (dashboard accuracy). There are deliverables such as reporting that is part of the project scope that was not developed but are considered a priority after the features and functionality are improved. According to the OG developer, a GitHub account for our organization will need to be created and code uploaded to two separate projects – one for backend and one for frontend. Let me know if this project would be something you would like to further discuss. Thank you so much for your time and consideration. More information from the OG developer follows: Developer should specifically know (or be able to learn) these specific AWS features since they will be responsible for deployment and maintaining the system. For deployment, the developer must:  modify AWS security groups and target groups, etc…  push code to product **DO NOT REMOVE OG DEVELOPER ACCESS/NETWORK CONNECTION** Currently, there are GitHub actions created that will deploy the code if you set up the proper secrets, GitHub actions on FE/Angular app with deploy code to our static S3 website as well as creations invalidations for CloudFront that bypasses the caching. An ssh config link and key file are available. Need to be able to pull reports on call info by unit, by caller, by diagnosis, physician or across the hospital, specifically on flags for medications, conditions, ect. – Flags and marked issues also need to be represented on the Facility Dashboard page. – Automate the import process of file from hospital. – Set up or ability to set up Hospital employees to log in with their Blessing Credentials (single sign on). – Flags thrown need to show up somewhere in Call Navigator and also be able to go into them and view patients and issues. Right now, the only notification and way to view this is strictly through email. – Ability to hover over icons on Facility Dashboard and see info and be able to click on info and have a page with that info pop up. – On the Discharge tab, when setting a filter, we want that filter to stay set unless we change it. Right now, if you set a filter and then go into a patient, when you come back out, the filter is not set anymore and you have to set all over again. – Need to be able to pull reports on call info by unit, by caller, by diagnosis, physician or across the hospital, specifically on flags for medications, conditions, ect.  – Flags and marked issues also need to be represented on the Facility Dashboard page. – Automate the import process of file from hospital. – Set up or ability to set up Hospital employees to log in with their Blessing Credentials (single sign on). – Flags thrown need to show up somewhere in Call Navigator and also be able to go into them and view patients and issues.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/building-a-real-time-log-file-visualization-dashboard-in-kibana/", "title": "Building a Real-Time Log File Visualization Dashboard in Kibana | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": " A leading IT Tech firm in the USA IT IT Consulting, Support, IT Development  300+ To create a dashboard that visualizes log files in Kibanna Organizations often generate massive volumes of log files from various systems and applications, which contain crucial information about system performance, errors, security events, and user activities. However, manually analyzing these log files can be time-consuming and inefficient, especially when attempting to identify patterns, anomalies, or potential issues in real time. The challenge is to create a centralized dashboard in Kibana that can efficiently visualize log files, enabling users to monitor system health, detect anomalies, and analyze logs quickly. This solution must support real-time data updates, offer customizable visualizations, and provide users with the ability to filter and drill down into specific log events to enhance operational visibility and decision-making. 1.  :    – Export the log data from Kibana or your logging system into a file format that Python can read. Common formats include CSV, JSON, or plain text. 2.  :    – Use Python’s file handling capabilities to read the log file into your script.  3.  :    – Use regular expressions to extract error codes from each log entry. Define a pattern that matches the format of your error codes. For example. 4.  :    – Count the occurrences of each error code using Python’s collections. Counter or a similar method.  5.  :    – Export the processed data (error codes and their counts) to a format that Kibana can ingest. We  exported the data to Elasticsearch directly using the Elasticsearch Python client, or you can save it to a file (e.g., CSV) and import it into Kibana manually. 6.  :    – Once the data is available in Kibana, create visualizations (e.g., bar charts, pie charts) based on the error code counts. You can also create dashboards to combine multiple visualizations and monitor the error trends over time. Here’s a solution architecture for the workflow: 1 :    – Log data is exported from Kibana or the logging system into a file format such as CSV, JSON, or plain text. 2.  :    – A Python script is executed to process the exported log data. 3.  :    – The Python script reads the log file and extracts error codes using regular expressions.    – Error codes are counted to determine their frequency. 4.     – The processed data (error codes and their counts) is exported to a format suitable for ingestion into Kibana. 6.     – The processed data is ingested into Kibana. This can be done either directly into Elasticsearch (the backend datastore of Kibana) using the Elasticsearch Python client or by importing the data into Kibana manually. 7.     – In Kibana, the ingested data is used to create visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, or any other suitable visualization to represent the count of log error codes.    – Dashboards can be created to combine multiple visualizations and provide a comprehensive view of the log error trends over time. Kibana Dashboard 1.  :    – Challenge: Log data often arrives in unstructured or semi-structured formats, requiring preprocessing steps such as data cleaning, parsing, and normalization. Inconsistencies in log formats across different systems can further complicate preprocessing efforts. 2.  :    – Challenge: Integrating different tools and technologies within the tech stack seamlessly can be challenging. For example, connecting Python scripts responsible for log data processing with Elasticsearch for data ingestion into Kibana requires careful configuration and compatibility considerations. 1.  :    – Solution: Develop robust preprocessing pipelines using tools like Python’s `pandas` library or scripting languages to clean and parse log data. Implement techniques such as regular expressions to extract relevant information from log entries. Utilize data wrangling techniques to handle inconsistencies and outliers effectively. 2.  :    – Solution: Utilize APIs, SDKs, or libraries provided by the tools to facilitate integration. Ensure compatibility between different components of the tech stack by adhering to supported versions and protocols. Leverage middleware solutions or data integration platforms to streamline communication and data flow between disparate systems. Regularly test and validate integrations to identify and address any compatibility issues proactively.

This information is utilised to make key business choices. Businesses should invest in data management systems that increase visibility, dependability, security, and scalability to ensure that workers have the required data for decision-making. The client wanted to get the data management process automated using a tool from Python. Multiple operations like merging,sorting, filtering had to be performed on data from various resources. The data resources were mainly csv files and data from SQL queries in PostgreSQL.  The project solution contained two tools that would aid in automatic efficient data storage. The first tool will concatenate all of the CSV files before merging them with the data from the SQL file. The acquired Excel file will be used as input for the second tool. The second tool will sort, filter, and lookup the Excel file received in the first tool. This tool will add columns that will be useful for the client’s analysis. The major goal is to assist the client with data management while requiring as little manual labour as possible. The files obtain the needed data in an Excel file by giving the proper input files. The project deliverables can be divided into two parts: Two types of databases were used: Google excel sheets and PostgreSQL. Some minor challenges were faced such as data discrepancies generated during the automation process.   The challenges were solved by reworking on the automation tool and consulting with the clients for their requirements.  It is critical to use appropriate data management procedures to ensure the smooth running of a firm. Furthermore, data management must be very precise, cost-effective, and completed as soon as possible. The inability to handle data can result in costly consequences and a permanent stain on the company’s image. Every company is responsible for developing a robust data management plan. The following are some of the reasons why data management is critical to the success of the firm. Instant Availability of Information: Data management makes information easily available for quick access based on company needs. Data management is also essential for accounting procedures like auditing and other strategy-based operations like company planning. The more time you spend hunting for misplaced files and missing documents, the less productive you will be. And you are aware that time is money. Keeping all of your documents structured might therefore assist to make procedures run more smoothly and quickly. Compliance: The government passed legislation requiring businesses to maintain these data. There are also periodical checks to verify that there is no manipulation. Furthermore, if a corporation is involved in a dispute, they must maintain these records for years until a solid verdict on the matter is reached. Faster Transitions to New Technology: Because technology trends change so quickly, organizations must embrace whatever comes their way. Losing information due to obsolete or outdated systems is the last thing you want for your company. Every piece of data preserved in the firm records is essential for everyday operations, managing multiple divisions, completing computations, audits, and so on. Make Right Business Decisions: Businesses use a variety of information sources for company planning, trend research, and performance management. To execute the same activity, different departments’ teams employ different sources of information. Because the legitimacy and precision of information are highly dependent on the source, analyzing several sources may have a detrimental influence on the organization. Robust data management prevents this from happening.

You might know these terms from high school economics defining utopian conditions in the marketplace. One involves having instantaneous knowledge of all market prices, utilities, and cost functions. The other involves selling each customer a good as per his individual willingness to pay. Well, these so-called utopian conditions are just a few among the many impossibilities that have been made realities due to Big Data & Analytics.  Big Data and Analytics is the perfect couple; statisticians often refer to ‘sample size’ (the number of people used to estimate a model) and believe that as the sample size tends to a larger number, it eventually gives a better estimate. This is what Big Data does, increasing the sample size to make a precise model which applies to every case. Marketing and sales are one of those areas where it is revolutionizing the existing structures to make a more consumer-pleasing platform. The domain of  and the infusion of Big Data in each of these has enhanced its dynamics in ways which couldn’t have been imagined ten years ago.

Using the petabytes of data it generates every hour it made a predictive analysis with the previous data to discern that the sales of Poptarts increased multifold with hurricane forecast. Stores find out patterns using their database to create sales predictions. It is optimized using analytics, figuring out what products will people buy with a specific type of good and then keeping them together increases the units per transaction (UPT). Ever wondered why when you went on a trip to a humid place, there was a product advertisement of an anti-frizzy hair shampoo? The Weather Channel’s doesn’t just predict the weather; it predicts the kind of sales that would increase or decrease due to weather and season change, thereby able to promote according to your location. This is the enabling of big data analysis in the domain of  A father of a teenage girl found baby vouchers and crib discounts mailed to her name by Target, a departmental store in the United States of America. Unsuspectingly, he accused Target of putting ‘wrong ideas’ in his daughter’s head, while in actuality; the girl had an upcoming baby. The store had made predictions about the pregnancy using a model which would track the kind of purchases a pregnant customer had made in the past by accumulating data and shaping a predictor, thus giving them a head start to promote their store and baby-related products. requires timing and the skill of executing it in the right manner. It takes place in two stages; pre-production and the release of the product. The pre-production commercialization would focus on the branding of prospects of an upcoming product that satisfies customer needs like never before. Then, during commercialization, they focus on the geo-necessity and demand of the products. Using real-time analysis, firms personalize their target allocations. Big Data enlarges our opportunities to understand the consumer brain better.  One of the ways how customer reaction is gauged the quickest is using the  which combined statistical modeling with linguistic rules to judge the positive or negative feedback (or sentiment) to the kind of product or advertisement they look at and respond to. Sentiment Analysis would help you identify your customer base, your negatives, and scopes of improvement. In today’s time, it’s difficult for the market to create a loyal customer. There are innumerable options, and each seems better than the previous one. Customer retention can be brought about by building a relationship with them, in which they begin trusting the seller. Costco, after analyzing the data of other fruit stores and shops predicted a possible contamination of a few fruits, after which they personally called and messaged their customers to send out warnings about their purchases which included those fruits that they sold hence, conveying out a message that indicated ‘We care.’ By catering to the needs of customers using their opinions from social media websites, reviews, ratings, and personalization give insights into new product developments and improving the existing ones adapting to the customer pain points and resolving them to an extent. The acumens are made by taking into account what the consumer likes and dislikes about a product. Models are devised that determine the demand curve of a product, they predict the sales of the product and assess the brand strength, awareness, and preference of a company. Online fashion stores are working towards automated personalized clothing without any human intervention so that they can offer better choices to each buyer, amongst the millions of clothes in their online wardrobe. In the near future, Big Data may be able to make insightful applications and technology customized to your needs because it will learn from and about you beforehand. It has come a long way and it has a long way to go changing everything imaginable into a reality.   \n \n We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

Dashboard should include visualizations of sentiments, FOIA requests, stock prices, volume, borrow rate, etc. Create real-time dashboards to get insights about the data and to analyse the relative change in different activities. Someone filing FOIA SEC request or FOIA FDA request and/or registering for conference calls might also have posted some negative tweets on tweeter to influence the market. Dashboard should display data of requests, sentiments, stock prices, etc on the same timeline, so that we will be able to observe the changes and relative changes with respect to time. Make separate dashboard for 2 stock symbols to analyse the activities and changes specific to that and a dashboard for all the data, eg. stocks, requests, etc. Change in sentiments effecting the price of the stock, borrow rate, trading volume, etc. should be noticeable. There is a list of names, make alert on the dashboard when the requests are filed by them on the same timeline used for other data. Also include the candlestick chart to view the stock details like open, close, high, low, volume with respect to time.  For FOIA SEC and FDA requests, made a metric chart representing the total number of requests and requesters, created a date histogram to view the frequency of requests and requesters with respect to time, bar chart to view the top requester name, organization, category, pie chart to view the proportion of final disposition of requests and tag cloud for the description of the requests for the entries present in the selected time range and a search table that contains the selected columns (only relevant ones) for both SEC filings and FDA filings. Similarly, for citation data, created a date histogram to view the frequency of citations and names of firms who posted with respect to time and bar chart to view number of citations by firm in the selected time range and a search table that contains the selected columns (only relevant ones). Index containing fail to deliver data is used to plot the date histogram in which volume failed is represented by the bar along the line representing the price at that time, bar chart where bars represents the total volume failed to deliver with respect to stock symbol and average price of the stock symbol in the selected time range by a dot size add on and tag cloud of the stock symbol as per fail to delivers. For twitter data (short seller’s data), made a pie chart to show the proportion of polarity, metric table to show the highest 10 average retweets with respect to user name, made a date histogram to show the frequency of tweets as per time and another date histogram representing the amount of positive and negative sentiments with the help of bars as per time to leverage us to observe if change in amount of sentiments is affecting price of stock, volume in trade and fail to deliver, etc., bar chart to show the total posts and number of posts in the selected time range and another bar chart to show the count of followers and friends in the index in selected time range. A search table is made with columns like polarity, follower counts, retweets and post with timestamp to get precise info of what we have in visualizations. For the list of names to be tracked on requests made and to make alert for them, added a annotation on the TSVB graph and added all of these along with the above visualizations on the dashboard on Kibana to make it a real-time dashboard and we can use this dashboard to do relative analysis. For the dedicated dashboards to the stock, created and added following visualizations: 3 dashboards- 1 dashboard for complete data and 2 dashboards dedicatedly for one stock each.  Kibana and Elasticsearch Visualizations and analytical skills were used Following databases are used to: AWS Management Console As I was using Kibana and studying the stock data for the first time, I faced challenges in making complex visualizations and understanding the terms related to stock data. Using filters while making Vega Charts to make candlestick chart with inconsistent data was displeasing. Challenges related to the creation of complex visualization was solved exploring options on the Kibana and getting reference from the online sources. In order to understand the stock information and how things work, I got immense amount of knowledge from the client and from my project manager. For filtering of data in Vega charts I took help from the online sources.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/ai-and-its-impact-on-the-fashion-industry/", "title": "AI and its impact on the Fashion Industry | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "If you were a fan of the 90’s film  back in the day, then you’ll remember the protagonist,  amazing virtual wardrobe. She used it to browse her clothing and choose a perfectly coordinated ensemble. This virtual application, which was just the brainchild of a writer wanting to make the protagonist look rich, fashionable, and ahead of her time, ignited a buzz and prospected having an automated style device to make everyday dress-up fun and engagingly time-saving. Times have changed and technological advancement today is transforming everything from probabilities to possibilities. We are in the era where, machines not just facilitate our tasks and demands but rather suggest, forecasts, and analyze thus making lives simpler and smarter. With the advent of technology, style suggestions are just a fraction of the big picture that AI has painted in the fashion industry today. Artificial intelligence is the creation of computer programs capable of performing activities and solving issues that would normally need human intelligence. AI has surged across a variety of industries, with the potential to transform businesses through creative technologies and more effective operational processes. At first, AI automation did not appear to be an appealing tool for fashion leaders to use in an industry focused on creative ability and expression. However, as we enter the hyper-digital era, these apps have the potential to revolutionize enterprises and generate considerable industry growth when compared to competitors that use traditional approaches. Some of the most well-known brands in the business are now investing in algorithms that assist buyers to choose designs. A slew of AI-based start-ups is also assisting everyone from retailers to customers in removing the guesswork from the equation. This article examines how artificial intelligence has impacted key areas of the fashion industry, as well as explores brands that have benefited from its use. Fashion firms are utilizing technology to better understand client wants and produce better garments thanks to more sophisticated data collection. Tommy Hilfiger pioneered the “Reimagine Retail” project, which trains fashion designers with AI design skills in collaboration with IBM. As a result, fashion students could master a variety of technical skills such as natural language processing (NLP) or computer vision. Fashion students could learn from thousands of fashion-related photos using AI, which increased their inventiveness and shortened lead times for the fashion firm. Fashion brands are now able to identify fast-changing fashion trends and get the latest fashion accessories to store shelves faster than the “traditional” fashion shop, thanks to AI and machine learning capabilities. As a result, prominent fashion brands such as Zara, Top Shop, and H&M can provide immediate gratification to retail customers by identifying seasonal trends and producing the appropriate quantity of the current items. AI in inventory and supply chain management helps to speed up processes by optimizing routes and lowering logistics and shipping costs. Companies use AI to automate logistics and supply chain procedures for speedier delivery or to locate alternate routes for vehicles that have been detoured due to unanticipated situations like bad weather or road construction. Owing to lockdown, major fashion firms had to rethink their go-to-market strategy overnight, with actual brick-and-mortar stores closed and people staying away from shopping malls. Myntra finds itself in a unique position to assist them. Myntra moved its whole data infrastructure, including supply chain management, inventory, and website capabilities, to Microsoft Azure just before the pandemic. Apart from giving Myntra the flexibility to respond to demand spikes, Azure’s built-in Machine Learning technologies sped up the development of advanced analytics capabilities, allowing them to better understand their customers. In retail, AI and machine learning are also providing an automated solution to monitor customer activities while shopping and visualize their sentiments to learn what products they prefer to buy and what products they ignore. AI can also track traffic in retail stores or record consumer shopping experiences, with the option of receiving feedback on how their experience was while shopping at the store, allowing them to enhance their services. Uniqlo has AI-powered UMood kiosks that offer clients a selection of products and use neurotransmitters to assess their reaction to color and style. The kiosk then makes product recommendations based on each person’s reactions. Customers don’t even need to press a button for the system to know how they feel about each item; their brain signals are plenty. Furthermore, AI in fashion is enabling each of us to find those elusive perfect garments that suit our body types and fashion preferences. These AI-enabled garments and ensembles are personalized to the user’s style, body type, colors, and current fashion trends, as well as different situations and weather. iLUK is an AI-based personal stylist that uses Computer Vision and 3D Reconstruction technology at its core to provide technology-based personal styling. It’s shaped like a pod that will be placed in a store. Similarly, a smart mirror driven by AI is being utilized by a company to streamline consumers’ shopping experiences by allowing them to virtually visualize how items would appear on them without having to put them on their bodies. The AI smart mirror with touch screen glasses is mounted in the changing room of retail stores and relays information on whether or not a person is inside. Customers can also use this mirror to try on other sizes and colors, as well as receive tailored mix-and-match alternatives to complete the appearance. Van Heusen designed a storage space that includes a “Virtual Trial” mirror that allows customers to view how clothes might appear on them by scanning the item’s barcode and stepping in front of the mirror while virtual clothing is projected onto their reflection. In the same way that AI is revolutionizing retail fashion stores, AI is revolutionizing online purchasing and E-commerce. While browsing or searching for fashion goods on e-commerce sites, AI suggests additional items that are similar to what you’re looking for based on your color preferences, budget, and other factors. It analyses your search history data and suggests more relevant stuff you should look at. Amazon has undoubtedly transformed the online shopping experience with its AI-powered product suggestion engine. Amazon is implementing an AI-enabled fashion designer algorithm that can create clothing by mimicking the design styles of several popular garments and applying them to a new garment. The Echo Look fashion assistant, which uses machine learning to deliver personalized recommendations, is Amazon’s other use case. AI-based visual search technology is now employed by E-commerce stores to comprehend the content and context of these photographs and produce a list of related results. You can capture an object using your camera and then search for it online. Retailers can use AI-enabled computer vision-based visual search technology to propose thematically or aesthetically relevant items to customers in a way that would be difficult to do with only a word query. Neiman Marcus, a high-end department store, employs artificial intelligence to make it easier for shoppers to locate things. The Snap. Find. Shop. the app allows users to photograph items they encounter while out and about, and then search Neiman Marcus’ inventory for the same or a comparable item. One of the most damaging businesses on the earth is the fashion industry. Artificial Intelligence can be used in conjunction with Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Visual Recognition, and Data Analytics to reduce trend prediction errors and more precisely forecast patterns, leading to fewer garments being manufactured and subsequently underutilized. The H&M Group is using “Amplified Intelligence,” which combines analytics and AI with human intelligence. Using artificially intelligent technologies, H&M is enhancing its ability to recognize trends and organize logistics, as well as minimizing the frequency of discounted deals and large amounts of unsold goods. Though intelligence per se is artificial, nevertheless is likely to have an earnest impact, both positive and negative: Apparel manufacture is a labor-intensive industry in the fashion industry. AI-enabled machines and robots can perfectly stitch fabrics while also detecting fabric flaws and providing quality assurance to ensure that the actual design hues will match the new colors. In nations like Bangladesh, where the garment industry accounts for 80% of the GDP, this will have a significant influence on the labor force in the long run. It is already feeling the heat from these specialized AI-based devices, thus jeopardizing the jobs of breadwinners. AI should not be viewed as a rival, but rather as a collaborator. The cost and ethics of AI are currently preventing us from progressing. We must be careful not to use technology to increase inequity or exacerbate social injustice. We also need to find a balance and integrate humanity into the machines we’re constructing in the future. “We are being monitored and classified by AI in portions of our lives that were not previously watched,” says Sophie Hackford, a futurist and keynote speaker. She wonders if we’ve built the “wrong” internet. We created it intending to monetize our viewers in mind, rather than the dynamic knowledge-sharing area that Tim Berners-Lee envisioned at the start.” She believes that in the future, we will be much more selective in how we obtain information, and that “bots” would be critical in meeting our requirements. As a result, the gains will come at the expense of our privacy. As numerous as AI’s advantages are, it is impossible to ignore the difficult issues it brings. With everything being data-driven, there is a pressing need to establish boundaries to build a shared ecosystem that benefits both businesses and the general public. Finding a wise balance between physical stores and online stores will continue to be a crucial issue in an industry where brick-and-mortar retail locations are still an important element of the sector’s approach to business. The usefulness of chatbots aimed at improving online and in-store product navigation shows significant promise for preserving customer attention and use in the near term. We expect consumers to become accustomed to these capabilities over time, and the field to become more competitive as AI becomes more broadly applied, as prominent brands set the tone with their usage of AI. It’s too early to tell how these AI applications will affect earnings and cost savings because prominent fashion firms are still in the early stages of AI implementation. However, there will be a learning curve as corporations figure out how consumers react to these innovation efforts, which could have a direct influence on sales.

No one spares time for someone. so robots tackle life loneliness? We have no time to stand and stare. This causes loneliness. Loneliness is due to fast-moving life and hurry and worry. In the 21st century, everyone is spending most of their time earning money. They are day-by-day transforming into money-earning machines. Due to his perception, we are losing our relations as we can’t give enough time to our families. They are busy earning their livelihood. They never get satisfies and always want more. Everyone is in a race of earning and then sends his children far away from himself to make them well settled in order to maintain their status. But one faces the consequences of this kind of lifestyle in his old age. People usually don’t spend time with their children when their children are in their childhood but they yearn for the company of their children in their old age. They feel lonely but have none to talk with. They are still attached to people, places, belongings, and memorable events from the past, although they understand that life cannot continue the same way as earlier, and this may easily result in feelings of loneliness and social isolation. As they become older, they need to be attended to in order to meet their daily needs. Robots can indeed serve the purpose but they can aid only mechanical care. They are just emotionless, feeling fewer entities. Robots aren’t creative. They can work only according to a pre-programmed system and till now no such software has been created that can transfer human feelings into robots. This is the major loophole of using robots to tackle late-life loneliness. They can undoubtedly serve their masters but their masters can’t share their feelings with them as they are incapable to understand or react to them. They can’t change their activity according to the occasion. They can provide anything except emotional satisfaction and without emotional gratification, loneliness can’t be tackled. A master can be attached to his robot but that attachment is only due to their service. They can’t share their thoughts with them. In this era, we are rendered lonely and in late- life feel the need for a companion with whom we can talk. We feel a need for someone who can listen to us, react, and advise us to tackle our day-to-day life problems. But we can’t find one. We have, undoubtedly, achieved great progress in terms of technology but we can never fill the void in the heart of a person struggling with his late-life loneliness with our advancements. We are in a kind of mental trance in which we experience fame, progress, wealth, etc. but when we gain our consciousness, we find ourselves lonely in this world. Relations in life are actual wealth in a person’s life. We can never enjoy such a bond with a robot. It will follow our commands, take our appropriate care but can’t react to our emotions. It can’t console us. When a man lives in loneliness for a long time, it eats up his conscience and transforms him into a machine. Robots can never become our friends, crack jokes, weep our tears, or establish an emotional connection with us. They can’t understand our feelings. Many people go into depression. Depression or the occurrence of depressive symptoms is a prominent condition amongst older people, with a significant impact on their well-being and quality of life. They remain sick and loneliness directly impacts longevity. Lonely people often think that they are no longer needed in this world and thus they want to die. It impacts their mental, psychological, social, and physical health. Robots prove to be useless in these matters. They can provide motivation, only if they have the software to do so but can’t, themselves, react to such a situation. They don’t know about anger, happiness, or sadness. They don’t themselves bring food when their master is hungry until commanded to do so. They can’t even offer a glass of water themselves. A man living without relations and without fellow feeling no longer remains a human being. He becomes none less than a machine as, due to his loneliness, he becomes mentally ill and goes into a condition like trauma where he no longer enjoys nature’s blessings, becomes happy or sad as he loses the ability to react and hence can’t act. It’s a dangerous situation. We face a plethora of challenges in assisted living facilities such as not being addressed to emotional needs, being neglected, and forcing a withdrawal from social activities. Relations in life, interaction with fellow beings, sharing of joy and happiness, and fellow feeling make a man from mere a ‘being’ to a ‘ ’ and finally a  .

Their brand is not just a picture, a logo, and colors; but an emotional connection with the consumer. It develops by making an impression on the consumers each time they interact with the products or services and it becomes ingrained in the consumers’ minds. Now, if it takes great efforts to build such impression, recognition, and trust, why would a firm do something controversial that could burn their own hands? We see hundreds of ads a day, but only a few get noticed. Here is where a controversy comes into play. We would definitely notice something that disagrees with our thoughts or mentally disturbs us. So, such ads stand out. In controversy marketing, a firm creates a controversy which gains them attention really quick, and the word spreads widely. They believe that in order to stand out, they can’t play it safe always. A controversial campaign could be about a social issue that could divide the masses, stating political opinions, or presenting something that doesn’t associate with their image etc. Key features of a well-crafted controversial campaign: Advantages of controversial marketing:  Disadvantages of controversial marketing: Examples of controversial marketing strategies: In the end, we can say that controversial marketing is a double-edged sword. On one side, it benefits the firm by increasing its reach to the masses, and making more people conscious about the brand; on the other, it puts the brand value itself at stake. So, it has to be carefully planned, and a backup measure should always be kept ready to reduce the impact in case it backfires.  Every such campaign should be thoroughly weighed in for the losses and benefits before execution.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/coronavirus-impact-on-energy-markets/", "title": "Coronavirus impact on energy markets | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "As the coronavirus spreads around the world and countries implement containment measures, energy supply and demand is being disrupted. The impact that country-wide lockdowns and demand slowdowns will have on energy markets will be evolving every day. The recent slump in German wind capacity is likely to continue this year as complicated regulations and weakness in the global economic outlook due to the coronavirus are likely to dampen investment in the renewable technology. This has the potential to restrict future additions to wind output, impacting supply and, in turn, supporting power prices. Chinese natural gas demand from the industrial sector in March was down by almost 25% year on year, according to the Chongqing Gas and Petroleum Exchange released over Easter, as the impact of the coronavirus continued to weigh on consumption. A growing number of British energy suppliers could be at risk of colllapsing through reduced energy offtake and cash-flow constraints amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to industry sources polled by ICIS. Power consumption continued to soften across key European demand centres through March and the first week of April, while less stringent measures and colder weather has sheltered other parts of Europe. While the coronavirus outbreak is already having a significant impact on the European renewables sector, one unintended consequence of the pandemic is likely to be the achievement of EU and member state binding renewable energy targets for 2020. This is due to the consequences of a prolonged downturn in demand, which will not be normalised for by the EU’s official statistics office (Eurostat), meaning that renewables look set to make up a higher share of consumption in 2020 across the EU. Spanish power prices across the curve are expected to maintain a bearish trajectory throughout the nationwide coronavirus lockdown period which was recently extended until 26 April, with further extensions possible. Nevertheless, forecasts for below-average wind generation would support Spanish spot prices, allowing France to continue exporting power to Spain. This in turn should keep Spanish near-curve contracts at a premium to their French equivalents. Market sources have indicated the coronavirus has reduced demand for truck-loaded LNG around Europe, as countries have implemented lockdown measures and low oil prices have made gas less competitive as a transport fuel. Data from terminals in northwest Europe shows the impact has not been as significant as originally thought. Electricity consumption has leveled out in Germany, France and Italy, after falling for several weeks due to restrictions aimed at stemming the spread of the coronavirus. But in Great Britain and Spain, demand has continued to drop week on week in recent days, according to an ICIS model that controls for the impact of temperature across Europe’s five largest consumers of electricity. In order to assess the fundamental impact of COVID-19 on European power and carbon markets we modelled a scenario in which we accounted for the first data on dropping electricity demand as well as assumed industry production cuts and continued travel restrictions. India buyers are deferring LNG cargoes as ports close operations with strict lockdowns in place. This is a concern for sellers in a long market with India one of the key buyers. The combination of Brexit and lower demand associated with the coronavirus pandemic should enable the EU as a whole as well as many member states to reach their 2020 renewable targets, according to ICIS model run. European power demand will continue to drop as governments escalate measures to stem the spread of the coronavirus. Electricity consumption in Italy and France fell 16% below expectations over the past seven days, according to an ICIS model that controls for the impact of temperatures. Three other major power markets studied by ICIS – Germany, Spain and the UK – have seen smaller drops, although all are trending down. • Power demand drop likely • ICIS model indicates 6% drop in demand during 2020 • Price fall of 9% across Europe A scenario where power demand drops one-tenth through up to June as a result of measures taken to slow the spread of the coronavirus would see power prices across European markets fall by an average 9% in 2020. • Temperatures across NW Europe to tumble in week 14 • British local distribution zone demand to increase • EAX-NBP premium gaining Incoming cooler weather across Britain for week 14 could encourage buying across NBP prompt and near curve contracts in the coming sessions. The drop in temperatures will likely trigger a spike in heating demand which has also increased due to large numbers of people working from home to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Eastern European and Turkish energy companies are braced for sharp drops in demand and potential bankruptcies as countries introduce emergency measures in a bid to contain the coronavirus outbreak. Although the spread of the virus is not as extensive in this region as in Italy or Spain, the impact of the emergency measures that have been taken is likely to be felt acutely because national economies are fragile. Power sector demand across key European countries is set for a major slump over the coming weeks as countries scale-up their efforts to tackle the spread of the coronavirus. Demand in Italy, which has been hit the hardest by the outbreak, has dropped 10% compared to its five-year average for March during the second week of its nationwide lockdown. As measures to tackle the spread of the virus intensifies across other European countries, a similar drop in demand can be expected, although changes are unlikely to be uniform. The impact of the coronavirus in China has reduced but gas demand will still end March well down from 2019. City-gate gas demand has been firm but the outlook for other sectors remains a concern. • EU-wide demand crunch could follow after lockdowns intensify • Residential demand to see brief increase before falling on warmer temperatures • LNG sellers could struggle to deliver into Europe Mexico’s economy has perhaps never been more exposed to the global supply chains and commodity markets hit by the shocks of the coronavirus and the oil price war, but its president is losing time engaging in denial and political pandering. These will not help his party’s 2021 election prospects if the country’s economic performance falls further as its currency takes a beating amid capital flight. Emissions of nitrogen dioxide are on the rise in China. This is an indication that economic activity is rising as businesses and industry ramp up activity with the coronavirus impact subsiding. Spain is home to one third of Europe’s LNG import capacity, so a lockdown has the potential to further gum up the global LNG supply chain if, as seems likely, it leads to a drop in demand for gas and a reduced ability to support scheduled imports. European nuclear power availability is expected to remain robust with strict safety measures already being implemented by the major plant operators amid the coronavirus outbreak. Bulgaria’s free energy market association ASEP has called for measures to tackle national power market disruption due to the coronavirus outbreak on 16 March. Heightened concerns surrounding the economic fall-out from the coronavirus is set to further weigh on European energy markets, traders say. Widespread remote working due to the coronavirus is set to hit European natural gas and power liquidity, according to traders. A number of firms have already asked traders to work from home or are expected to do so. While some trading activities around gas and power dispatching need to be done from a trading floor, most other tasks can be done from home. However, traders indicated it is unlikely to be business as normal with participants increasingly risk averse away from an office environment. The coronavirus outbreak took a toll on Italian gas demand in week 11 as the government extended nationwide restrictions against the spread of the virus. If restrictions continue, demand and gas prices are likely to fall further as warmer temperatures follow spring, pressuring consumption for heating. Power prices are also expected to plunge on the back of weaker gas. Gas is Italy’s main source for power generation and the marginal fuel, therefore a price maker for Italian power. • Coronavirus impact on LPG to worsen • China’s big three will have sought some LNG volume deferrals as another means by which to deal with the mounting oversupply • Incremental demand for gas and LNG this summer will be unusually low The Italian wholesale electricity market has so far avoided major losses following the outbreak of the Coronavirus in the country, the strongest so far across Europe.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/how-will-covid-19-affect-the-world-of-work-2/", "title": "How will COVID-19 affect the world of work? | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "As business close to help prevent transmission of COVID-19, financial concerns and job losses are one of the first human impacts of the virus; COVID-19 is in decline in China. There are now more new cases every day in Europe than there were in China at the epidemic’s peak and Italy has surpassed it as the country with the most deaths from the virus It took 67 days to reach the first 100,000 confirmed cases worldwide, 11 days for this to increase to 200,000and just four to reach 300,000 confirmed cases – a figure now exceeded. In recent weeks, we have seen the significant economic impact of the coronavirus on financial markets and vulnerable industries such as manufacturing, tourism, hospitality and travel. Travel and tourism account for 10% of the global GDP and 50 million jobs are at risk worldwide. Global tourism, travel and hospitality companies closing down affects SMEs globally. This, in turn, affects many people, typically the least well-paid and those self-employed or working in informal environments in the gig economy or in part-time work with zero-hours contracts. Some governments have announced economic measures to safeguard jobs, guarantee wages and support the self-employed, but there is a lack of clarity in many countries about how these measures will be implemented and how people will manage a loss of income in the short-term. Behind these statistics lie the human costs of the pandemic, from the deaths of friends and family to the physical effects of infection and the mental trauma and fear faced by almost everyone. Not knowing how this pandemic will play out affects our economic, physical and mental well-being against a backdrop of a world that, for many, is increasingly anxious, unhappy and lonely. Fear of the unknown can often lead to feelings of panic, for example when people feel they are being denied life-saving protection or treatment or that they may run out of necessities, which can lead to panic buying.Psychological stress is often related to a sense of a lack of control in the face of uncertainty. In all cases, lack of information or the wrong information, either provided inadvertently or maliciously, can amplify the effects. There is a huge amount of misleading information circulating online about COVID-19, from fake medical information to speculation about government responses. People are susceptible to social media posts from an apparently trustworthy source, often referred to as an “Uncle with a Masters”-post, possibly amplified and spread by “copypasta” posts, which share information by copying and pasting and make each new post look like an original source, as opposed to posts that are “liked” or “shared” or “retweeted”. Sadly, criminals and hackers are also exploiting this situation and there has been a significant rise in Coronavirus-themed malicious websites, with more than 16,000 new coronavirus-related domains registered since January 2020. Hackers are selling malware and hacking tools through COVID-19 discount codes on the darknet,many of which are aimed at accessing corporate data from home-workers’ laptops, which may not be as secure as outside an office environment. Social distancing and lockdowns have also prompted altruistic behaviors, in part because of the sense that “we’re all in this together”. Many people report being bored or concerned about putting on weight; others have discovered a slower pace of life and by not going out and socializing have found more time for family, others, and even their pets. The downside of self-isolation or social lockdown are symptoms of traumatic stress, confusion and anger, all of which are exacerbated by fear of infection, having limited access to supplies of necessities, inadequate information or the experience of economic loss or stigma. This stress and anxiety can lead to increased alcohol consumption, as well as an increase in domestic and family violence.In Jingzhou, a town near Wuhan in Hubei province, reports of domestic violence during the lockdown in February 2020 were more than triple the number reported in February 2019. Health measures must be the first priority for governments, business and society. It is important for businesses to show solidarity and work together to protect staff, local communities and customers, as well as keeping supply chains, manufacturing and logistics working.According to research, “my employer” is more trusted than the government or media. Daily updates on a company website with input from scientists and experts are recommended to counter politicized messages in the media and from governments. This is particularly true for large companies that have the capacity to do this. Messages about what businesses are doing for their employees and in their communities is also important. Some companies are helping schoolchildren from vulnerable families who can no longer get a school meal; others are providing public health messages about effective handwashing. Even CEOs can show they are working from home and self-isolating, while still being effective in their leadership. Following WHO advice, there is a need for the business community to move from general support to specific actions and focus on countries’ access to critical supplies, including a “Community Package of Critical Items” (a list of 46 items that all countries need). Of these items, 20 are either not available locally or available stocks are too limited. These missing items fall into four categories: The call for action is for more money, to work with manufacturers to create capacity and to organize purchasing so there is guaranteed access, especially for poorer countries with less resilient public health systems. The concept is to create a global security stockpile of supplies and equipment, an effort that needs: We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/how-artificial-intelligence-can-deliver-real-value-to-companies-2/", "title": "How Artificial Intelligence can deliver real value to companies? | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "Today we talk a lot about artificial intelligence and how it will change our future. But we don’t know what it actually means. Let us see what is artificial intelligence. Artificial Intelligence was coined in the 1950s as a task which is performed by a machine with the intelligence a human can use to complete the task. In layman language, it acts a situation in the same manner in which a human would act. If the human can answer to a question in a conversation, so would AI can. It analyses the information and makes future decisions, in the same way in which a human would. AI basically works on an algorithm. It uses a computers intellect to solve the problem quicker and more accurate than a human can. AI mostly consists of statistical information to find trends and patterns in the data. AI can perform various functions like analyzing, planning, problem-solving and learning. Another part of AI is Machine Learning, which gathers information, learns and adapts as it accumulates new data. The artificial intelligence consists of three main stages. This is the first stage of AI as it functions narrowly. It functions like an infant baby where it covers only one functional area. ANI can be used in the best manner when you have to use it in a reparative manner. It is very cost saving as we do not need to hire any human and pay him on a monthly or weekly basis. This is the stage which is the biggest achievement in the entire humanity as it covers a broad area in the technological space. Humans have finally constructed a machine which not just think but also has the reasoning ability. With AGI, machines now have an ability similar to humans. Machines have become capable of doing things which are performed by humans. AGI is working with governments and organizations in problem-solving and abstract thinking also. However, it is still in evolution and it will take some time to replace all the abilities of a human and work parallelly with him. But with this can humans sustain? ASI is the final stage of artificial intelligence as predicted by the scientists in which machines will automate the tasks where average human intelligence is used. If AI reaches that stage it will not only discover the mysteries of the universe but also able to solve the problems which are not discovered by mankind right now. AI has narrowed the gap between businesses and technology, it reduced the burden of tasks on skilled individuals and it has helped in easing decision making processes. The traditional IT methods, which are solving precise, specific and repetitive problems have reduced the business and technology to one of user and tool. AI’s powerful reasoning and contextualizing ability are now making businesses to be more proactive with their forecasts and solutions. Traditionally where a business model is forcing humans to define rules for machines to follow, AI has derived its own rules from data which is provided to it. This has led to businesses taking less time to ask questions and more time to act on the answers. The time which skilled labor used to take in modifying their tools to ensure their inferences are correct, the more time can be spent on working proactively on solutions for their businesses. AI will not replace the workers but AI will add value to their skills with which they can leverage their businesses. The self-healing and adaptable power of AI programs will help management to stop worrying about the logistics of data and to start thinking on ways to leverage this power to discover the areas which were impossible to explore because off less time or insufficient information. In today’s technological world businesses are about to shift from more reliance of human decisions, less forecasting errors and few necessities for subjective management calls will help organizations with improved ability to predict and respond accurately to customer and clients’ needs. Artificial Intelligence is not just limited to top multinationals anymore, a lot of rapidly growing Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) are entering into the AI market. It is predicted by research firm Spiceworks that around 30% of the businesses will embrace AI by the end of 2018, an increase from just 13% in 2017. Rapidly growing AI-based technologies are driving development in nearly every sector. As we move ahead, AI will make sure businesses have incorporated these five areas. Machine learning algorithms can predict more accurate results than humans. The ability of artificial intelligence to analyze data to increase sales is one of the lucrative features many marketing firms are using. AI algorithm can drive through a large volume of user data to find trends and patterns, which will revolutionize the ways companies do effective marketing and help to leverage the content strategy. A recent Harvard report has shown analyzing chat logs for words and phrases can build successful sales by as much as 54%. Search engines like Google trends can help in capturing the trends of a particular product category with times with the help of keywords. Social media activity can provide AI algorithms like Amazon’s recommendation system with enough user data to analyze purchasing trends of individual users. Jeff Wilke, CEO of Amazon of the worldwide consumer, uses behavioral-tracking AI algorithms in place of traditional memory-based marketing algorithms. AI can help companies with their pricing strategies- AI can track price trends of a product category for higher profit margins. Machine learning algorithms can automate various tasks of human workers, freeing time, resources and money for businesses. While critiques say that this as a start of robots taking over humans and loss of jobs for humans, most businesses tend towards a more practical view. AI is a perfect complement to the human resources of a company. The technology will reduce the burden on administrative functions of a company, allowing its workers to focus more on creative and engaging work in more essential areas. According to Richard Branson, companies must empower their people to make on the spot decisions and think on their feet. Employees efforts and talent can be used more efficiently by freeing them from traditional tasks. Human emotions can be very complex to measure for AI, but the technology has surprised everyone with an application called ‘Emotional Analysis’. The use of surveys, social media, image recognition software and lots of other techniques, some AI algorithms are dedicated completely to analyze human perspectives on a host of topics with more reliability. The emotional analysis will enable companies to predict consumer behavior. The emotional analysis technology was used for PM Narendra Modi’s election campaign to judge people’s opinion towards policies of the UPA government. Using AI algorithms, companies can decide their marketing campaign in a changing market. Daily operations of a business can be improved with the help of AI algorithms, resulting in higher growth of the business. AI algorithms can analyze areas of supply chain and workflows to identify the improvements in business. A streamlined workflow will result in effective utilization of the company’s resources and it will reduce the costs due to low response time, maintenance and redundancy will be minimized. With AI in place, manufacturing firms can streamline their daily operations. Forbes magazine reported that with the integration of AI the production capacity rose to 20 percent and a drop in materials used for manufacturing operations by 4 percent, improving business operational efficiency. Before making the investment in AI algorithm, it is necessary for companies to have all the tools required for the better functioning of AI algorithms. Proper estimation of the internet speed must be done and the type of professionals required an additional cost that may incur in the future. For optimum use of AI, it is not necessary to hire a data scientist to integrate it with business. A large number of companies are making user-friendly AI tools for entrepreneurs and Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs). One of the examples is an AI-powered application called Grammarly is helping businesses with consistent, high-quality writing across the company’s brand, while a tool called Legal Robot is helping companies in developing clear and compliant contracts and legal documents. A number of companies are using predesigned chatbots for customer services and in employee training programs. AI-powered chatbots have improved natural language processing to a large extent, which is leading to utilizing for them in customer services. The use of chatbots has reduced response times for human service agents. Although machine learning and artificial intelligence have incorporated into businesses, their full potential is still not being explored. AI although being used by many organizations it is still in the nascent stage and will take time to develop to its full potential. Early adoption of AI will help companies to sustain by predicting trends and taking corrective actions. The limitless applications of AI will provide companies with opportunities to innovate and differentiated in the competition. ****   \n \n We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/ai-ml-project-workflow/", "title": "The 8 Steps of AI/ML Project | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "This first step is where the objective is defined. This step is also where comparable scenarios and current workarounds to a given problem are discussed, as well as assumptions being contemplated, and the degree of need for human expertise determined. Other key technical items to frame in this step include determining which type of machine learning problem (supervised, unsupervised, etc.) applies and adopting an appropriate performance metric(s). This step is data-centric: determine how much data is needed, what type of data is needed, where to get the data, assess legal obligations surrounding data acquisition… and get the data. Once you have the data, ensure it is appropriately anonymized, make certain you know what type of data it actually is (time series, observations, images, etc.), convert the data to a format you require of it, and create training, validation, and testing sets as warranted. This step in the checklist is akin to what is often referred to as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The goal is to try and gain insights from the data prior to modeling. Recall that in the first step assumptions about the data were to be identified and explored; this is a good time to more deeply investigate these assumptions. Human experts can be of particular use in this step, answering questions about correlations that may not be obvious to the machine learning practitioner. Studying features and their characteristics are done here, as is general visualization of features and their values (think of how much easier it is, for example, to quickly identify outliers by box plot than by numerical interrogation). Documenting the findings of your exploration for later use is good practice. In this step, apply data transformations you identified as being worthy in the previous step. This step also includes any data cleaning you would perform, as well as both feature selection and engineering. Any feature scaling for value standardization and/or normalization would occur here as well. In this step, model the data, and whittle the initial set of models down to what appears to be the most promising bunch. Such attempts may involve using samples of the full dataset to facilitate training times for preliminary models, models that should cut across a wide spectrum of categories (trees, neural networks, linear, etc.). Models should be built, measured, and compared to one another, and the types of errors made for each model should be investigated, as should the most significant features for each algorithm used. The best performing models should be shortlisted, which can then be fine-tuned afterward. The shortlisted models should now have their hyperparameters fine-tuned, and ensemble methods should be investigated at this stage. Full datasets should be used during this step, should dataset samples have been used in the previous modeling phase; no fine-tuned model should be selected as the “winner” without having been exposed to all training data or compared with other models which have also been exposed to all training data. Also, you didn’t overfit, right? Be a good seller. This step requires presentation skills and how a good story can be driven by the model results. Answer questions for interested parties:   This is essentially a sales pitch, so ensure the takeaway is confidence in the system. Why do all this work if the result isn’t understood and adopted? Especially, create an outstanding report or a deck to tell the data story, and how ML models results can help the business leaders to address their business problems. Explain the driving forces, key drivers, risks, growth, ROI, and the most important is future strategy.  Get the machine learning system ready for production; it will need to be plugged into some wider production system or strategy. As a software solution, it will be exposed to unit testing prior and should be adequately monitored once up and running. Retraining models on fresh or updated data is part of this process and should be taken into account here, even if the thought had been given to this in an earlier step.

However, the lockdown and pandemic have hit our college life and routine hardly. Others were celebrating the ‘long weekend’ they got, but unaware of the loss it caused. Sitting in an online class was equivalent to watching an online course. Without interaction and gossip, the classes were lifeless. Soon we started missing classrooms and canteens. Nostalgia was immense and coping with it was another rock-like problem. The college campus not only gives live interaction and engagement but opens the door for hundreds of opportunities. And the major benefit, we get from seniors is their advice, but we were so unfortunate about this. Luckily I attended the mechanical workshops, civil engineering workshops, my juniors didn’t get a chance to attend all these. The following were the big problems we faced Shifting to an online class was like switching from a 300-inch screen to a 5-inch screen. The offline classes were HD large screen TVs then the online class is a 5-inch phone screen. Neither students nor the teachers were able to adjust. We used to watch online lectures but for a few hours and that too twice or thrice a week. And I honestly admit that watching a web series is different than attending an online class unless someone forgets to mute themselves. Teachers found it hard to make students understand everything with one whiteboard. It took us 1 year to become used to these classes. College students are careless. Believe it or not, engineering students are lazy, careless, and crazy. But have the brightest mind. Some attend class while eating, some are half sleepy and some are living in another world. While students playing games, using social media were very common, there was a small group of nerds who never miss a single class. The carelessness will cost us later, everything in engineering is important. Once in an online class, someone started sharing their screen, because an option was of the same colour in another app but the purpose was different. And after that, everyone saw his app collection, chats, and what else not. Someone messaging them to stop sharing the screen and they won’t stop. ‘I won’t turn on my video, I have no data left’. This line was most listened to, sometimes as an excuse or as a valid reason. Even students who have Wi-Fi access complained the same. Cheating, if allowed seems a boon to students. But it’s boon or bane, consequences will tell. During online exams, everyone was scoring full marks. Those who could not fail in cheating. It was an exam of googling things, copying, or what only students can answer. For students, online exams mean exams of searching answers and copy-paste skills. Out of all your seniors, 70% will do ragging, take introductions and 30% will guide you right. We collide with 70% because they are highly interested in us and we meet 30% when we are interested in them. It is hard to find a person who gives you good advice but online classes were not helpful in this. Thanks to Linkedin for this. The first year of engineering is all about trying out different things. From going to the library to wandering on campus, everything has its own importance. Lockdown limited everything to few inch screens. I say the first year, they hear fresher’s party I say last year, they hear Farewell party I say the second and third year, they say let’s give’em party But we missed all the get-togethers in lockdown. Colleges teach different skills in workshops, classes. Lockdown made us deprived of all of these. Many students become prey to Ed-tech and not-for-them internships. They wasted time in affiliate marketing, sales internship, and irrelevant. Not able to get books delivered, problem in reading e-books affected many placements. This is all about problems faced by engineering students. Although the problems seem unsolvable still it was a rare and unforgettable experience for all of us. For us it was like, a child was dreaming of not going to school, and the next day god gave him the world he wanted to see. I was a college freshman when the lockdown was announced and had no idea how long this virus will cause havoc. I was a junior student in my college, who has just stepped into college life. And when the virus impact is not too high, I am a college junior. So this is my journey and experience from a junior of someone to someone’s senior. Lockdown taught us many things 1.         Life never stops challenging you 2.         Never stop learning 3.         You have to come out of your comfort zone for making miracles happen We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

Monetization is about data selling but is foremost the creation of new digital products and services that are fostered by data. These new services are the key\ndifferentiators of the most innovative companies. Service Design is the best\napproach to innovate and create new data monetization applications. Today, mega-companies such as Facebook and Google\nderive a large portion of their revenue from the effective utilization of data.\nThey have mastered the art of data monetization — turning data assets into\ncold, hard cash. These companies offer a free, public service that allows them\nto harvest massive amounts of data about their users. They then provide this\ndata — for a fee — to advertisers that want to create a personalized\nmarketing experience. Here are several potential opportunities for data\nmonetization: But to really know if you’re ready to\nmonetize, you need to access what you have before you attempt to earn revenue\nfrom your information, make sure that it is: Business models are already changing through the\nexploitation of information. To be successful in this age of data monetization,\nyou must think creatively about how you hire talent and develop leaders. The C-suite executives who will help your business\nsucceed today, and certainly tomorrow, will be different from the people who\nled blue-chip firms 30, 20 or even 10 years ago. The route you take to data\nmonetization will have an impact on the resources and capabilities your\norganization needs to steal a march on its rivals. You — and your people — must adapt to this second wave of big data exploitation, where insight shapes the new product and service development. If the way to make dollars is through data, then your organization and its people must make that shift. Get your capability ready now. External data monetization models vary by level of value\nimpact to customers, analytics sophistication, and revenue potential. Also known as data\nsyndication, this is the simplest of the three business models. Anonymized and\naggregated data are sold either to intermediate companies or end customers who\nmine the data for insights.   Companies also\ncan combine internal and external data sources, applying advanced analytics to\nprovide actionable insights. AkzoNobel has created a decision-support model for\nship operators to enable fuel and CO  savings. They make\navailable to ship operators and owners an advanced analytics-enabled mobile iOS\napp that provides continuous performance prediction of coating technologies.\nThis approach empowers vessel operators by allowing financial and performance\nbenefit analysis of coating choices, thus optimizing important investment\ndecisions. This is the most\ncomplex of the three business models, and it offers the greatest value to\ncustomers. Companies use sophisticated and proprietary algorithms to generate\nenriched, highly transformed, customized real-time data delivered to customers\nvia cloud-based, self-service platforms.  To maximize the potential for internal and external monetization,\ncompanies should set up a “data factory” that automates the process of\ncollecting, enriching, transforming, and deriving insights from data. It’s a\ncomplex undertaking requiring a set of design principles that touch on design\nthinking, lean start-up, and agile methodologies for success. The architecture and technology stack that supports a data monetization business model typically involves a robust enterprise data strategy, and a “data platform” with an intuitive interface to allow analysis, synthesis, modeling, and interaction with the data at a higher, more visual level. All companies are data companies, and most have a substantial amount of\nuntapped, underutilized data, which could unlock tremendous financial value. There are three key components to complementing and even transforming a\nbusiness model with a data factory: Very few organizations\nhave established methods for data asset management. It is not easy to implement\nif the business is not built on data from the beginning. But it is not enough\nfor data to be used only for the purposes of monitoring and maintaining\nphysical assets. That data needs to be monetized. This, in part, is a process\nof generating new revenues from data that currently serves another purpose. The business of data monetization is likely to evolve\nquickly. Payments providers would be well advised to begin planning their\nstrategy without delay: first-mover advantage may determine future success. A\n“start small, scale fast” approach allows for flexibility, learning, and course\ncorrection as the business develops. Partnerships with complementary players in\npayments and in the digital and start-up ecosystem could be a winning factor.\nHow much value could be created is difficult to estimate at this early stage,\nbut experience in some use cases and markets suggests it could amount to\nbetween 5 and 10 percent of revenues.

It comes in various forms, from the tales told around ancient campfires to the dazzling spectacles of modern cinema. Traditionally, we relied on television, radio, and theatres to satiate our thirst for entertainment. However, a new dawn has emerged with the advent of  , which deliver a wide array of digital content directly to consumers over the internet,  the way we consume content. These platforms, accessible at the tap of a screen, are redefining the entertainment landscape, and their impact is both revolutionary and intriguing. As we project into the future, it is evident that the impact of OTT platforms on the entertainment industry will be profound by 2040.  This essay explores the factors contributing to the rise of OTT platforms, their current significance, and the potential implications they may have on content creation, distribution, consumption, and the traditional media landscape. The landscape of entertainment underwent a remarkable transformation with the rise of Over-The-Top (OTT) platforms, a shift that can be traced back to the early 2000s. This period marked the inception of a new era in content consumption, led by pioneering companies like  , which dared to venture into uncharted territories of streaming content over the internet. In their initial stages, these OTT platforms focused on a rather modest goal – providing a digital reservoir of older movies and   This innovative approach offered a departure from conventional entertainment delivery methods, introducing the concept of on-demand viewing. No longer were audiences tethered to rigid schedules dictated by traditional television broadcasts or cinema showtimes. Instead, viewers could now delve into a treasure trove of content at their convenience, ushering in a  The convenience of   was the first ripple in the pond, setting the stage for an even more profound transformation. As internet infrastructure and connectivity improved, a fertile ground was created for OTT platforms to flourish. With the  , consumer preferences began to shift, demanding not only convenience but also diversity and originality in content offerings. Recognizing this demand, OTT platforms embarked on a journey to reinvent themselves. They swiftly evolved from being mere repositories of nostalgic classics to becoming  . This strategic pivot marked a turning point, shaking the very foundations of   As OTT platforms unleashed their creative prowess, they embraced storytelling in all its diverse forms – from gripping dramas and thrilling mysteries to heartwarming comedies and eye-opening documentaries. This creative renaissance shattered the monopoly that traditional media had held for decades, offering a level playing field for both established and emerging storytellers. The expansion of OTT offerings wasn’t merely a quantitative growth; it represented a qualitative leap. Audiences were no longer limited to a predetermined menu of content; they were handed the reins to an expansive universe where choice and personalization reigned supreme. This revolution ignited a ripple effect across the entertainment industry, influencing content creators, and production studios, and even influencing the very way stories were conceived and told. 1. OTT platforms offer unparalleled convenience and personalization. Viewers can access content whenever and wherever they want, catering to their schedules and preferences. The ability to create personalized profiles, curated recommendations, and watchlists has created a more tailored and engaging viewing experience. 2.  : OTT platforms have invested heavily in producing high-quality original content, ranging from TV series and movies to documentaries and stand-up specials. This commitment to diverse and compelling content has attracted a broader audience and positioned OTT platforms as formidable competitors in the entertainment industry. 3.   The global accessibility of OTT platforms has broken down geographical barriers, enabling content creators to reach audiences worldwide without the limitations of traditional distribution channels. This has fostered cross-cultural exchange and enriched content diversity. 4.   Advancements in streaming technology, including improved video compression algorithms and faster internet speeds, have facilitated seamless content delivery. This has reduced buffering issues and enhanced the overall user experience, further incentivizing consumers to adopt OTT platforms. 5.   OTT platforms have disrupted traditional media models by offering subscription-based and ad-supported options that challenge the conventional pay-TV model. This disruption has prompted traditional media companies to adapt and create their streaming services, intensifying competition within the industry. As of the present day, OTT platforms have already significantly transformed the entertainment landscape. Major players like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, and Hulu have amassed massive subscriber bases, challenging the dominance of cable and broadcast television. The ability of these platforms to produce critically acclaimed and culturally impactful original content, such as Stranger Things, The Mandalorian” and “The Crown” has further solidified their place in popular culture. OTT platforms have also revolutionized content consumption habits. Binge-watching, or consuming multiple episodes of a TV series in rapid succession, has become a cultural phenomenon enabled by the release of entire seasons at once. This shift in viewing behaviour has influenced storytelling techniques and narrative structures, as content creators aim to engage audiences over extended periods. Looking ahead to 2040, the impact of OTT platforms on content creation and distribution will likely be even more pronounced. The ability of these platforms to gather vast amounts of user data and insights will enable content creators to make more informed decisions about the type of content that resonates with audiences. This data-driven approach may lead to more targeted and innovative storytelling, resulting in a diverse range of content that caters to various tastes and preferences. Additionally, the direct-to-consumer model of OTT platforms eliminates the need for traditional distribution channels, reducing intermediaries and production costs. This may empower independent filmmakers and creators to showcase their work to a global audience, democratizing the content creation process and fostering creativity and diversity. However, the dominance of OTT platforms could also pose challenges to content diversity. While these platforms have expanded the range of stories being told, there is a risk that certain niche genres or perspectives may be overshadowed by the pursuit of mass appeal. Content algorithms that prioritize popular genres could limit exposure to lesser-known content, potentially hindering the discovery of unique voices. The rise of OTT platforms has fundamentally shifted consumer behaviour and expectations, and this trend is likely to continue. The demand for instant gratification, personalized recommendations, and a seamless viewing experience has set a high standard for the industry. By 2040, we can expect consumers to expect even more immersive and interactive experiences, driven by advancements in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies. Furthermore, the concept of “cord-cutting” – the act of cancelling traditional cable or satellite TV subscriptions in favour of OTT platforms – is projected to become the norm by 2040. As more households transition to streaming services, the traditional TV ecosystem could undergo a profound transformation, leading to changes in advertising models, revenue streams, and the overall content landscape. By 2040, OTT platforms will have catalyzed a revolution in content creation. The democratization of production tools and distribution channels will empower a diverse range of creators to showcase their talents on a global stage. The boundaries of storytelling will be pushed, giving rise to narratives that reflect a spectrum of cultures, perspectives, and experiences. Personalization algorithms will refine content recommendations, ensuring that each individual’s entertainment journey is a unique and engaging one. The traditional broadcast and cable TV models, once the stalwarts of entertainment, will be shadows of their former selves. The dominance of OTT platforms will relegate scheduled programming to nostalgia, as audiences demand the freedom to curate their viewing schedules. Live streaming and real-time interaction will bridge the gap between virtual and reality, providing immersive experiences that redefine the concept of “appointment viewing.” The boundaries of geography will blur as OTT platforms transcend borders. By 2040, audiences around the world will effortlessly access content from diverse cultures, languages, and genres. The exchange of stories and ideas will foster cross-cultural understanding and appreciation, contributing to a more interconnected global society. The integration of emerging technologies, such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), will elevate entertainment to new heights. Viewers will step into the worlds of their favourite shows and movies, becoming active participants in the storytelling process. Immersive narratives and interactive elements will blur the line between fiction and reality, engaging audiences in ways never before imagined. The monetization landscape will undergo a profound transformation. Advertising models will evolve as targeted, non-intrusive ads replace traditional commercial breaks. Subscription-based and pay-per-view models will flourish, providing viewers with a plethora of options tailored to their preferences. The traditional “box office” concept will extend beyond theatres, as online premieres and exclusive releases become the norm. While the rise of OTT platforms presents numerous opportunities, it also raises important considerations and challenges for the entertainment industry. The proliferation of streaming services could lead to subscription fatigue, where consumers are overwhelmed by the sheer number of available platforms. This may drive some users to piracy or result in a decline in overall revenue for the industry. Additionally, issues related to data privacy and content moderation will continue to be significant concerns. The collection of user data to improve recommendations and advertising targeting raises questions about the ethical use of personal information. Furthermore, the open nature of online platforms can make it difficult to regulate inappropriate or harmful content, requiring industry stakeholders and policymakers to collaborate on effective solutions. In conclusion, the rise of OTT platforms has already made a substantial impact on the entertainment industry, and their influence is likely to be even more profound by 2040. The convenience, personalization, and global accessibility of these platforms have transformed content consumption habits and disrupted traditional media models. As we project into the future, we can anticipate further advancements in technology, changes in content creation and distribution, and evolving consumer behaviour and expectations. While the challenges posed by the rise of OTT platforms should not be overlooked, their potential to democratize content creation, offer diverse narratives, and provide innovative viewing experiences is undeniable.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/what-analytics-outsourcing-engagement-model-is-right-for-you/", "title": "What Analytics & IT Outsourcing engagement model is right for you? | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "Analytics & IT Outsourcing should be a strategic partnership, not a simple hand-off of duties to a third-party. Getting that right requires smart preparation. Implemented correctly, strategic partnerships are a happy collaboration where expectations of delivery and results are clear from the start. By bringing in outside minds, it’s possible to innovate and drive your product to levels beyond what your internal team might have accomplished. New ideas can come from anywhere. A proper planning phase is important. It’s not only about thinking ahead but also about being on the same page with your Analytics & IT Outsourcing provider every day and benefiting from their expertise, as opposed to viewing Analytics & IT Outsourcing merely as an easy way to offload commodity work. You need to select the proper engagement model that is transparent to both parties and provides strong governance for all aspects of the relationship. To accomplish that, it’s useful to understand the various Analytics & IT Outsourcing engagement models and how to best apply them to your situation—in the case discussed here, software development. An engagement model is a framework that defines collaboration between a client and an Analytics & IT Outsourcing vendor. It determines a level of control and responsibility, as well as provides a base for further relationship development. There is no “best” universal model to match every company`s needs. So how do you select an engagement model that works for your business? Here is a brief overview of the most popular models grouped into Tactical and Strategic engagements. There is no need to argue that the level of innovation from outsourced vendors with this model will be quite low in most cases. In fact, the less span of responsibility, the fewer drivers to innovate exist. With the Staff Augmentation model, the span of responsibility usually is quite narrow. It may include technical implementation tasks as well as prototyping, but the product vision and decision scope of the augmented team members are so limited that it doesn’t facilitate thinking outside of the box. It is important to set proper expectations and establish alignment between a client and Analytics & IT Outsourcing vendor on which party is responsible for steps in the Product Development Life-cycle – it helps avoid solving unpleasant issues in the future. The next three models belong to the strategic group as they are based on long-term and more innovative relationships between a client and the Analytics & IT Outsourcing vendor organization. The key takeaway is selecting a proper engagement model and ensuring that your tactical and strategic plans are shared with your partner will help you set up a solid foundation for further innovation. There is no need to stop at one or another level—continue evolving through engagement models over time to receive more value from long-lasting and fruitful partnerships.   \n \n We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/future-of-work-how-ai-has-entered-the-workplace/", "title": "Future of Work: How AI Has Entered the Workplace | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "Artificial intelligence and employment are the burning issues nowadays workers need clarity on as we head into the longer term. This article focuses on the various impact of AI on our jobs and explains the benefits of AI in our workplace. That right there must have hit a nerve. However, everything is about to change because this article highlights some of the reasons we should not fear AI. AI is the abbreviation of Artificial Intelligence. Artificial intelligence is often defined as a set of various technologies which will be brought together to permit machines to act with what appears to be human-like levels of intelligence. This includes learning rules required to make certain decisions and reasoning to arrive at certain conclusions, learning from past experiences, and self-correction. Expectations that machines could match humans in terms of general intelligence. By that, we mean machines could have the capability to find out, Reason, and React. Alan Turing develops the Turing Test; a test to determine whether a machine is intelligent.However, it wasn’t for another 60 years or so that any program was deemed to have passed. The first time a computer virus defeats a person’s World Champion during a parlor game. John McCarthy invents the new term ‘Artificial Intelligence’ when he held the primary Academic Conference on the subject of AI. Arthur Samuel‘s machine learning checkers (draughts) program, beat a checkers master. Reinforcement Learning is introduced. This is a kind of programming that uses rewards and punishments to coach a machine to interact with its environment. A research group led by Geoffrey Hinton wins the Image Net competition – this competition requires AI to categorize about 1.2 million images into any of 10,000 different categories. The level of accuracy was adequate to that of the typical human completing an equivalent task manually. Eugene Goostman’s chatbot, a bot pretending to be a 13-year-old boy, supposedly passes the Turing Test, a test which nobody has passed before! But controversy arose with this claim as: 1. Experts claim it only lasted five minutes. 2. It had been deemed biased as Eugene’s mother tongue (Ukrainian) wasn’t equivalent to the judge’s (English), which is a plus as language is one among the few ways we will tell the difference between a person’s and machine. Alibaba’s AI Model performs better than humans during a reading and comprehension test at Stanford University, scoring 82.44 against the 82.304 scored by humans! Artificial Intelligence (AI) is here to remain, and lots of people aren’t happy. After all, it’s hard to embrace something that would displace about 40 percent of human jobs within the next 15 years. In an interview for CBS’s hour, Kai-Fu Lee (a Chinese AI expert) also mentioned truck drivers, chauffeurs, waiters, and chefs as a number of the professions that will be disrupted. But if you were to ask the experts, they might unwaveringly confirm that no matter all the noise, AI is here to profit us all. Case in point, an executive briefing by the McKinsey Global Institute revealed that AI and automation are creating opportunities for the economy, society, and business. That said, it’s time to repress the widespread idea of artificial intelligence taking jobs. So, let’s highlight a number of the useful developments you’ll expect from this technological phenomenon. While the relationship between artificial intelligence and jobs is a matter of hot debate, it is still safe to say that AI will indeed offer new opportunities. According to the planet Economic Forum report, robots and AI will create as many AI jobs as they displace. This conclusion is entirely viable as it is easy to identify some of the many careers in artificial intelligence, for example, data scientists, who evaluate the decisions made by AI algorithms to eliminate any biases. Apart from that, some other AI occupations include: Transparency analysts: people tasked with classifying the varied sorts of opacity for algorithms. Smart-system interaction modelers: experts who develop machine behavior based on employee behavior. Machine-relations managers: people that champion the greater use of algorithms that perform well. As far because the competition for jobs between humans and robots goes, worth noting is that there are jobs that AI can’t replace. Roles that need leadership, empathy, and delegation are samples of the various jobs that are safe from automation. Automation will stir positive change in the workplace. When AI is employed during recruitment or maybe performance management, all workers are going to be evaluated in an unbiased, fact-based manner. In turn, Human Resources managers can get to consider other essential strategic undertakings that ensure balance within the workplace. AI can help HR departments to use machine learning (ML) in discovering where issues like bias stem from and assist them to act accordingly faster. ML shines in identifying instances of bias. In turn, this may promote fairness and variety within the work setting. The impact of AI in business is already felt, and this is often expected to continue through to the longer term. A few years from now, AI-oriented architecture is forecasted to require the lead in assisting businesses to hold out operations in additional comprehensive ways, thus shifting them from traditional data science and machine learning models. It will be necessary to maneuver to business outcomes because AI will play an important role in multiple aspects of the business. While there is no way of telling the future of artificial intelligence in business for sure, it makes sense for owners to keep up with the evolution to avoid being left behind. The workforce of the longer term will lean more towards innovation and creativity. Businesses have spent higher a part of the previous couple of years studying AI automation and the way they will leverage it to realize results fast. With statistics showing that workers spend up to 40 percent of their hours at work performing repetitive tasks, every business should consider automating any functions which will be automated. Automation is not new; machines have been replacing human labor in different areas for decades. However, within the coming years, mundane daily tasks will become fully automated. Already, 39 percent of organizations were completely reliant on automation in 2018. With repetitive tasks taken care of, employees can focus their energies on high-value customer-oriented tasks and collaboration. The designs of workplaces and workflows will also change with the implementation of AI technology. More people will begin to figure more closely with machines as companies will strive to become more agile. Companies that implement AI in their business strategy will experience dramatic improvements in their customer experiences, and their employees are going to be more motivated. Encouraging creativity rather than the performance of repetitive tasks gives workers more fulfillment in their jobs as well. With the web of things and AI working hand in hand, identifying trends and solving problems within the business world will become more convenient and also sustainable. AI, alongside other technologies, is predicted to vary the planet by impacting the way businesses run. With time, we’ll be ready to combine both human and artificial brains to seek out solutions to major global problems. It will even be easier to foresee problems with more accuracy and nip them at the bud with the help of AI. But these positive impacts can only be felt if stakeholders are transparent and mindful in their use of the technology for the greater good of everyone else. According to a report by PWC, 54 percent of companies confirm that the implementation of AI-driven solutions in their companies has already improved productivity. AI and automation, even once they are implemented partially, have unlimited potential for any business. Workers’ skills, attitude, training, command chain, and workflows protocols are a number of the leading productivity challenges that companies face. Apart from increasing productivity, AI systems will help businesses to chop down on costs, improve the standard of their products or services, and make better customer profiles. As a result, companies also will get higher profits, which may be shared among stakeholders as dividends, or reinvest it back within the business. Improved productivity also means firms are going to be ready to sell their products at lower prices, thereby creating more demand among customers and more job opportunities for workers. Businesses can, therefore, use human labor to take up those jobs that have been created by AI and cannot be automated. Artificial Intelligence isn’t showing any signs of slowing down. Soon, it’ll become another necessity of life, a bit like the web. But for now, more and more businesses are beginning to realize how invaluable AI automation and data interpretation are. Though machines will take some jobs initially, the roles created by automation will also keep soaring within the next few years. Will, we’ve reached the purpose of accelerating human intelligence by artificial means? Who knows? What we all know, however, is that those that are going to be sought-after in AI and employment are individuals who have the relevant skills. There’s work that not even the machines can do; so, we should make ourselves as valuable as we can be in our field and we will be irreplaceable.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/the-workflow-of-a-machine-learning-artificial-intelligence-project/", "title": "The workflow of a Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence project | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "In this document, we discuss the workflow of a Machine learning project this includes all the steps required to build the proper machine learning project from scratch. This document will help you to understand how we go over data pre-processing, data cleaning, feature exploration, and feature engineering and show the impact that it has on Machine Learning Model Performance. We define the machine learning workflow in 5 stages. The machine learning model is a piece of code; an engineer or data scientist makes it smart through training with data. So, if you give garbage to the model, you will get garbage in return, i.e. the trained model will provide false or wrong predictions. The process of gathering data depends on the type of project we desire to make, if we want to make an ML project that uses real-time data, then we can build an IoT system that using different sensors data. The data set can be collected from various sources such as a file, database, sensor, and many other such sources but the collected data cannot be used directly for performing the analysis process as there might be a lot of missing data, extremely large values, unorganized text data or noisy data. Therefore, to solve this problem Data Preparation is done. Data pre-processing is one of the most important steps in machine learning. It is the most important step that helps in building machine learning models more accurately. In machine learning, there is an 80/20 rule. Every data scientist should spend 80% time for data pre-processing and 20% time to actually perform the analysis. Data pre-processing is a process of cleaning the raw data i.e. the data is collected in the real world and is converted to a clean data set. In other words, whenever the data is gathered from different sources it is collected in a raw format and this data isn’t feasible for the analysis. Therefore, certain steps are executed to convert the data into a small clean data set, this part of the process is called as data pre-processing. As we know that data pre-processing is a process of cleaning the raw data into clean data, so that it can be used to train the model. So, we definitely need data pre-processing to achieve good results from the applied model in machine learning and deep learning projects. Most of the real-world data is messy, some of these types of data are: 1.   Missing data can be found when it is not continuously created or due to technical issues in the application (IoT system). 2.   This type of data is also called outliners, this can occur due to human errors (human manually gathering the data) or some technical problem of the device at the time of collection of data. 3.   This type of data might be collected due to human errors (mistakes with the name or values) or duplication of data. 1. Numeric e.g. income, age 2. Categorical e.g. gender, nationality 3. Ordinal e.g. low/medium/high These are some of the basic pre-processing techniques that can be used to convert raw data. 1.   As we know that Machine Learning models can only handle numeric features, hence categorical and ordinal data must be somehow converted into numeric features. 2.   Whenever we encounter missing data in the data set then we can remove the row or column of data depending on our needs. This method is known to be efficient but it shouldn’t be performed if there are a lot of missing values in the dataset. 3.   Whenever we encounter missing data in the data set then we can fill the missing data manually, most commonly the mean, median or highest frequency value is used. 4.  If we have some missing data then we can predict what data shall be present in the empty position by using the existing data. 5.   There are some error data that might be present in our data set that deviates drastically from other observations in a data set. [Example: human weight = 800 Kg; due to mistyping of extra 0] Our main goal is to train the best performing model possible, using the pre-processed data. In Supervised learning, an AI system is presented with data that is labeled, which means that each data tagged with the correct label. The supervised learning is categorized into 2 other categories which are “ ” and “ ”. problem is when the target variable is  (i.e. the output could be classified into classes — it belongs to either Class A or B or something else). A classification problem is when the output variable is a category, such as “red” or “blue”, “disease” or “no disease” or “spam” or “not spam”. These some most used classification algorithms. While a  problem is when the target variable is  (i.e. the output is numeric). As shown in the above representation, we can imagine that the graph’s X-axis is the ‘Test scores’ and the Y-axis represents ‘IQ’. So we try to create the best fit line in the given graph so that we can use that line to predict any approximate IQ that isn’t present in the given data. These some most used regression algorithms. In unsupervised learning, an AI system is presented with unlabeled, un-categorized data and the system’s algorithms act on the data without prior training. The output is dependent upon the coded algorithms. Subjecting a system to unsupervised learning is one way of testing AI. The unsupervised learning is categorized into 2 other categories which are “ ” and “ ”. A set of inputs is to be divided into groups. Unlike in classification, the groups are not known beforehand, making this typically an unsupervised task. Methods used for clustering are: For training a model we initially split the model into 3 three sections which are ‘ ’ ,‘ ’ and ‘ ’. You train the classifier using ‘ ’, tune the parameters using ‘ ’ and then test the performance of your classifier on unseen ‘ ’. An important point to note is that during training the classifier only the training and/or validation set is available. The test data set must not be used during training the classifier. The test set will only be available during testing the classifier.  The training set is the material through which the computer learns how to process information. Machine learning uses algorithms to perform the training part. A set of data used for learning, that is to fit the parameters of the classifier.  Cross-validation is primarily used in applied machine learning to estimate the skill of a machine learning model on unseen data. A set of unseen data is used from the training data to tune the parameters of a classifier.  A set of unseen data used only to assess the performance of a fully-specified classifier. Once the data is divided into the 3 given segments we can start the training process. In a data set, a training set is implemented to build up a model, while a test (or validation) set is to validate the model built. Data points in the training set are excluded from the test (validation) set. Usually, a data set is divided into a training set, a validation set (some people use ‘test set’ instead) in each iteration, or divided into a training set, a validation set and a test set in each iteration. The model uses any one of the models that we had chosen in step 3/ point 3. Once the model is trained we can use the same trained model to predict using the testing data i.e. the unseen data. Once this is done we can develop a confusion matrix, this tells us how well our model is trained. A confusion matrix has 4 parameters, which are ‘ , , and ‘ . We prefer that we get more values in the True negatives and true positives to get a more accurate model. The size of the Confusion matrix completely depends upon the number of classes. We can also find out the accuracy of the model using the confusion matrix. Accuracy = (True Positives +True Negatives) / (Total number of classes) i.e. for the above example: Accuracy = (100 + 50) / 165 = 0.9090 (90.9% accuracy) Model Evaluation is an integral part of the model development process. It helps to find the best model that represents our data and how well the chosen model will work in the future. To improve the model we might tune the hyper-parameters of the model and try to improve the accuracy and also looking at the confusion matrix to try to increase the number of true positives and true negatives.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/deep-learning-impact-on-areas-of-e-learning/", "title": "Deep learning impact on areas of e-learning? | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "eLearning as technology becomes more affordable in higher education but having a big barrier in the cost of developing its resources. Deep learning using artificial intelligence continues to become more and more popular and having impacts on many areas of eLearning. It offers online learners of the future intuitive algorithms and automated delivery of eLearning content through modern LMS platforms. This paper aims to survey various applications of deep learning approaches for developing the resources of the eLearning platform, in which predictions, algorithms, and analytics come together to create more personalized future eLearning experiences. In addition, deep learning models for developing the contents of the eLearning platform, deep learning framework that enable deep learning systems into eLearning and its development, benefits & future trends of deep learning in eLearning, the relevant deep learning-based artificial intelligence tools, and a platform enabling the developer and learners to quickly reuse resources are clearly summarized. Thus, deep learning has evolved into developing ways to re-purpose existing resources that can mitigate the expense of content development of future eLearning. It is natural to wonder where you might get AI tools to avoid the time and expense of developing your own. Don’t worry about the advert of AIaaS or “AI as a Service” even small education or learning & development professionals can purchase the license of AI tools and components. However, such types of tools cannot be useful for every e-learning ecosystem but may offer some enticing benefits such as adding standard AI tasks (logic, decision making) to your toolbox. Here are some of the AIaaS tools and platforms offered by famous tech giants most of which are cloud-based. Cloud-based AI services that can be used to build and manage AI applications like image recognition or bot-based apps Cloud-based AI services that can be integrated into your applications; to store and manage your own data  An end-to-end open-source machine learning platform Offers a wide range of products and services on Amazon’s cloud There are other AIaaS platforms such as DataRobot, Petuum, and H2O which shows that the field is expanding.AI will probably not make human workers obsolete, at least not for a long time To put some of your fears to bed: the robots are probably not coming for your jobs, at least not yet. Given how artificial intelligence has been portrayed in the media, in particular in some of our favorite sci-fi movies, it’s clear that the advent of this technology has created fear that AI will one day make human beings obsolete in the workforce. After all, as technology has advanced, many tasks that were once executed by human hands have become automated. It’s only natural to fear that the leap toward creating intelligent computers could herald the beginning of the end of work as we know it. But, I don’t think there is any reason to be so fatalistic. A recent paper published by the MIT Task Force on the Work of the Future entitled “Artificial Intelligence And The Future of Work,” looked closely at developments in AI and their relation to the world of work. The paper paints a more optimistic picture. Rather than promoting the obsolescence of human labor, the paper predicts that AI will continue to drive massive innovation that will fuel many existing industries and could have the potential to create many new sectors for growth, ultimately leading to the creation of more jobs. While AI has made major strides toward replicating the efficacy of human intelligence in executing certain tasks, there are still major limitations. In particular, AI programs are typically only capable of “specialized” intelligence, meaning they can solve only one problem, and execute only one task at a time. Often, they can be rigid, and unable to respond to any changes in input, or perform any “thinking” outside of their prescribed programming. Humans, however, possess “generalized intelligence,” with the kind of problem-solving, abstract thinking, and critical judgment that will continue to be important in business. Human judgment will be relevant, if not in every task, then certainly throughout every level across all sectors. There are many other factors that could limit runaway advancement in AI. AI often requires “learning” which can involve massive amounts of data, calling into question the availability of the right kind of data, and highlighting the need for categorization and issues of privacy and security around such data. There is also the limitation of computation and processing power. The cost of electricity alone to power one supercharged language model AI was estimated at $4.6 million. Another important limitation of note is that data can itself carry bias, and be reflective of societal inequities or the implicit biases of the designers who create and input the data. If there is bias in the data that is inputted into an AI, this bias is likely to carry over to the results generated by the AI. There has even been a bill introduced into Congress entitled the Algorithmic Accountability Act with the goal of forcing the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the use of any new AI technology for the potential to perpetuate bias. Based on these factors and many others, the MIT CCI paper argues that we are a long way from reaching a point in which AI is comparable to human intelligence, and could theoretically replace human workers entirely.  Provided there is an investment at all levels, from education to the private sector and governmental organizations—anywhere that focuses on training and upskilling workers—AI has the potential to ultimately create more jobs, not less. The question should then become not “humans or computers” but “humans and computers” involved in complex systems that advance industry and prosperity. This paper is a fascinating read for anyone hoping to dive deeper into AI and the many potential directions in which it may lead.AI Is becoming standard in all businesses, not just in the world of tech A couple of times recently, AI has come up in conversation with a client or an associate, and I’m noticing a fallacy in how people are thinking about it. There seems to be a sense for many that it is a phenomenon that is only likely to have big impacts in the tech world. In case you hadn’t noticed, the tech world is the world these days. Don’t ever forget when economist Paul Krugman said in 1998 that “By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet’s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine’s.” You definitely don’t want to be behind the curve when it comes to AI.  In fact, 90% of leading businesses already have ongoing investments in AI technologies. More than half of businesses that have implemented some manner of AI-driven technology report experiencing greater productivity. AI is likely to have a strong impact on certain sectors in particular: The potential benefits of utilizing AI in the field of medicine are already being explored. The medical industry has a robust amount of data, which can be utilized to create predictive models related to healthcare. Additionally, AI has shown to be more effective than physicians in certain diagnostic contexts. We’re already seeing how AI is impacting the world of transportation and automobiles with the advent of autonomous vehicles and autonomous navigation. AI will also have a major impact on manufacturing, including within the automotive sector. Cybersecurity is front of mind for many business leaders, especially considering the spike in cybersecurity breaches throughout 2020. Attacks rose 600% during the pandemic as hackers capitalized on people working from home, on less secure technological systems, and Wi-Fi networks. AI and machine learning will be critical tools in identifying and predicting threats in cybersecurity. AI will also be a crucial asset for security in the world of finance, given that it can process large amounts of data to predict and catch instances of fraud. AI will play a pivotal role in e-commerce in the future, in every sector of the industry from user experience to marketing to fulfillment and distribution. We can expect that moving forward, AI will continue to drive e-commerce, including through the use of chat-bots, shopper personalization, image-based targeting advertising, and warehouse and inventory automation. AI can have a big impact on the job search If you are moving forward with the hope that a hiring manager may give you the benefit of the doubt on a small misstep within the application, you might be in for a rude awakening. AI already plays a major role in the hiring process, so much so that up to 75% of resumes are rejected by an automated applicant tracking system, or ATS before they even reach a human being.  In the past, recruiters have had to devote considerable time to poring over resumes to look for relevant candidates. Data from LinkedIn shows that recruiters can spend up to 23 hours looking over resumes for one successful hire. Increasingly, however, resume scanning is being done by AI-powered programs. In 2018, 67% of hiring managers stated that AI was making their jobs easier. Despite the increasing prevalence of automation and algorithms in the hiring process, many have been critical of the use of certain types of AI by hiring managers, based on the charge that it can perpetuate and ever create more bias in hiring. One particular example is illustrated by HireVue, a startup whose initial services included technology that aimed to use facial recognition software and psychology to determine the potential effectiveness of a candidate in a certain role. The Electronic Privacy Information Center filed a lawsuit with the Federal Trade Commission alleging that this software had the potential to perpetuate bias and prejudice. HireVue discontinued the use of facial recognition software in early 2021, and now uses audio analysis and natural language processing. It’s clear that the use of certain types of AI in the hiring process will likely be controversial as new technology develops. However, if potential employers are using AI to process your application, there is no reason that you cannot be utilizing similar technology to your advantage. Jobscan is an excellent resource that provides similar resume scanning to what would be used by a hiring manager. By comparing your resume to a job description, Jobscan will give you information on how to tweak your resume so that it is a good match for a certain position, with the goal of “beating” an applicant tracking system (ATS). Jobseer is a browser add-on, and another great AI-based tool for those on the job market. Based on a scan of your resume, as well as keywords and skills related to your desired jobs, Jobseer will help match you with the job listings that best fit your experience. For each listing, you get a rating based on how well you are aligned with the particular posting, as well as recommendations of skills to add to better position your resume and experience. Rezi: Now, as a disclaimer, I would never encourage you to turn your resume writing over to a bot. But Rezi is an awesome AI-based resume builder that includes templates to help you design a resume that is sure to check the boxes when it comes to applicant tracking systems. This is a great jumping-off point to kickstart a new resume.  Another great way to use this type of tool is to generate a new resume and compare it to your current resume to see how it stacks up, and identify some areas for improvement. AI is also a great place to focus your energy if you are looking to upskill in your career, or make your professional profile more competitive in the job market, especially when you consider that AI will have such far-reaching impacts across many industries.AI and machine learning are at the top of many lists of the most important skills in today’s job market. Jobs requesting AI or machine-learning skills are expected to increase by 71% in the next five years. If you’d like to expand your knowledge base in this arena, consider some of the great free online course offerings that focus on AI skills. If you are tech-savvy, it would be wise to dive deep and learn as much as you can about interacting in the AI space. If your skills lie elsewhere, it is important to recognize that AI will have a big impact, and to the extent of your abilities, you should try to understand the fundamentals of how it functions in different sectors. AI is definitely here to stay, whether we like it or not. Personally, I don’t think we have anything to be afraid of. The best way to move forward is to be aware of and adapt to the new technology around us, AI included. This article was updated on April 16, 2021, to reflect changes in HireVue’s assessment tools.

{"url": "https://insights.blackcoffer.com/how-machine-learning-will-affect-your-business/", "title": "How machine learning will affect your business? | Blackcoffer Insights", "text": "Machine learning techniques may have been used for years, but recently there has been an explosion in their applications. In fact, in a recent Q3 earnings call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said “Machine learning is a core, transformative way by which we’re re-thinking how we’re doing everything.” And they’re far from the only business making that claim. In the past, successful use of machine learning algorithms required bespoke algorithms and huge R&D budgets, but all that is changing. IBM Watson, Microsoft Azure, Amazon, and Alibaba all launched turnkey cloud-based machine-learning SaaS solutions in 2015. At the same time startups like Idibon, MetaMind, Dato, and MonkeyLearn have built machine learning products that companies can take advantage of. Gartner already puts machine learning at the top of its hype curve, and no: machine learning won’t replace all of your employees with computers or suddenly double your revenue. But that doesn’t mean that it can’t give every business a competitive advantage. There are plenty of business processes that can significantly benefit from machine learning. So how does machine learning change the way businesses operate? First thing’s first: Machine learning needs training data and training data costs money. Especially training data labeled by humans. Let me explain. To make machine learning work for business, the algorithm needs to see lots and lots of examples of what it’s supposed to be doing. If you want an algorithm to tell you if a sales lead is good, you need to show it lots and lots of examples of good sales leads and bad sales leads. If you want an algorithm to tag the support tickets you need to show it many examples of support tickets. If you localize your algorithm to a new language you probably need to collect lots of examples in that language. In some instances, a company may have those training sets in-house. For example, a bunch of disqualified or qualified leads. But say you haven’t labeled each of your support tickets as they’ve come in over the year. You’d need to have people either in-house or en masse via a data enrichment platform -label those tickets. The machine will then look at those judgments and start finding connections and patterns it can learn from. Machine learning is much cheaper and more efficient than people when it works well. The downside is that it often works well in 80 percent of the cases and badly in 20 percent of the cases, and lowering the 20 percent error rate is hard, if not impossible. But even an 80 percent accurate algorithm can save you a lot of money because good machine learning algorithms know where they are accurate and where they are more likely to have errors. Smart companies take the cases where the algorithm has high confidence and uses those directly while sending low confidence cases to humans. Banks have been doing this for years. When you put a check in an ATM, an algorithm tries to decipher the numbers on the check. If you have really sloppy handwriting or the ink is smudged the algorithm passes the task to a human. This design pattern saves banks lots of money while preserving a very high level of accuracy. A huge benefit of machine learning is that it can turn part of your variable cost into more of a fixed cost. If you use humans to handle cases where that algorithm is struggling, you are creating the perfect training data to feed into your algorithm. This is a well-studied technique called active learning it turns out that training data labels collected on cases where the algorithm has low confidence help the algorithm learn much, much more efficiently. As the algorithm becomes increasingly more accurate, the unit economics of your business process become better and as machine learning becomes able to handle more cases, the expensive humans are only called in on the toughest, rarest situations. That means you use the best of both human and machine intelligence in tandem: leveraging the speed and reliability of computers for the easy judgments and the fluency and expertise of humans for the difficult ones. And if that sounds like smart business, it’s because it is.
